The list cost is calculated as `number of DBUs * list price per DBU at that moment in time`. Cost calculation only includes serverless jobs and job clusters. Interactive/SQL clusters are excluded. Account-specific rates and discounts are excluded.\n\nWe will be evolving it over time by adding more example queries and visualizations. The latest version will always be available in the GitHub link below.\n\n#### Documentation \n- Jobs System Tables (Private Preview) - Checkout the PDF attachment in the email titled **Welcome to Jobs System Tables Private Preview**, sent to the person who unrolled this account to the PrPr\n- [Latest Dashboard version GitHub](https://github.com/databricks/tmm/tree/master/System-Tables-Demo/Serverless-Jobs-Notebooks-PuPr/aws-serverless-jobs-and-notebooks-cost-observability.lvdash.json)\n\n#### Requirements\n- For the full experience, this dashboard requires select rights on **system.usage**,  **system.workflow** and **system.access.table_lineage** System Tables\n    - [How to Enable System Table Schema](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/system-tables/index.html#enable-system-table-schemas)\n    - [Grant access to system tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/system-tables/index.html#grant-access-to-system-tables)\n\n#### Feedback\nPlease use the [following form](https://surveys.training.databricks.com/jfe/form/SV_02LtKUVucz37Sgm) to provide feedback on this dashboard and Jobs System Tables\n\n#### Debugging\nFor detailed debugging instructions (how to find a job/run by ID) check out the guidance at the bottom of this dashboard.\n\n#### Upcoming improvements:\nWe'll roll out over the Q2 2024 following, non-breaking schema changes: \n- **created_by** field containing email addresses\n"
