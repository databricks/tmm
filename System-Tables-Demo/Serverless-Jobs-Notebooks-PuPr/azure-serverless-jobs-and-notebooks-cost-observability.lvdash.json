The list cost is calculated as `number of DBUs * list price per DBU at that moment in time`. Account-specific rates and discounts are not included. We will be evolving it over time by adding more example queries and visualizations, helping you keep track of spending on Serverless Jobs and Notebooks. For the latest version checkout documentation and GitHub link below.\n\n#### Documentation \n- [Serverless Notebooks](https://docs.databricks.com/compute/serverless.html)\n- [Serverless Jobs](https://docs.databricks.com/workflows/jobs/run-serverless-jobs.html)\n- [Latest Dashboard version on GitHub](https://github.com/databricks/tmm/tree/master/System-Tables-Demo/Serverless-Jobs-Notebooks-PuPr/aws-serverless-jobs-and-notebooks-cost-observability.lvdash.json)\n\n#### Requirements\n- This dashboard requires **system.usage** System Table\n    - [How to Enable System Table Schema](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/system-tables/index.html#enable-system-table-schemas)\n    - [Grant access to system tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/system-tables/index.html#grant-access-to-system-tables)\n\n#### Feedback\nPlease use the [following form](https://surveys.training.databricks.com/jfe/form/SV_6MeRdfngaqxqzum) to provide feedback on this dashboard & serverless jobs and notebooks cost observability.\n\n#### Debugging\nFor detailed debugging instructions (how to find job/notebook/run by ID) checkout the guidance at the bottom of this dashboard."
