You‚Äôll start by building a **Knowledge Assistant** grounded in company product docs and historical support tickets, then expand it with a **Genie-powered structured data agent**. Finally, you‚Äôll orchestrate them together with a **Multi-Agent Supervisor** and guide the system to produce better, user-friendly responses.\n"
