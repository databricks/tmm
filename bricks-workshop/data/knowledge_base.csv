KB-1002,FAQ,Billing,Paper bill vs. electronic billing,What's the difference between paper bills and electronic billing?,"# What's the difference between paper bills and electronic billing?

## Overview
Paper bills are traditional printed statements mailed to your home address, while electronic bills (e-bills) are digital versions accessible through your online account or via email. Both contain the same billing information, but offer different benefits depending on your preferences.

## Paper Bills
Paper bills are mailed to your postal address around 5-7 days after your billing cycle date. Each paper bill includes:

- A detailed summary of charges
- Itemized call records (for non-unlimited plans)
- Payment stub for mail-in payments
- Special notices and promotional information

**Cost:** There is a $2.99 monthly paper billing fee applied to most accounts. This fee helps cover printing and postage costs while encouraging environmentally friendly alternatives.

**Example:** If your base plan is $59.99/month with a $12.99 device payment, your total before the paper billing fee would be $72.98. With the paper billing fee, your total becomes $75.97.

## Electronic Billing
E-bills provide the same information as paper bills but are delivered digitally. You can:

- View bills immediately when they're ready (typically 1-2 days after your billing cycle date)
- Access up to 18 months of billing history
- Download PDF versions for your records
- Set up email or text notifications when new bills are ready

**Cost:** E-billing is completely free and helps reduce paper waste.

## How to Switch Between Billing Methods
### To switch to e-billing:
1. Log into your account via our mobile app (iOS/Android) or website
2. Navigate to ""Billing Preferences"" or ""Billing Settings""
3. Select ""Paperless Billing"" and confirm your email address
4. Save your changes

### To request paper billing:
Follow the same steps above but select ""Paper Billing"" instead. Please note the $2.99 monthly fee will apply.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I receive both paper and electronic bills?**
Yes, you can receive both, but the $2.99 paper billing fee will still apply.

**Q: How will I know when my e-bill is ready?**
You'll receive a notification via email or text (based on your preference settings) when your new bill is ready to view.

**Q: What if I don't receive my paper bill?**
If you haven't received your paper bill 10 days after your billing cycle date, please contact us. Your payment due date remains the same regardless of when you receive your bill.

**Q: Will switching to e-billing affect my automatic payments?**

KB-1005,FAQ,Billing,Prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?,"# What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?

Prepaid and postpaid are two different ways to pay for your mobile service, each with unique features and billing processes.

## Prepaid Service

With prepaid service, you pay for your usage **before** you use it. Here's how it works:

- **Payment timing**: You purchase credit or a plan upfront before using any services
- **No credit check**: Generally doesn't require a credit check to sign up
- **No monthly bill**: Instead of receiving a bill, you'll get notifications when your balance is low
- **Plan duration**: Typically 28-30 days, depending on the plan
- **Data usage**: When you reach your data limit, your data speeds may reduce to 2G/128kbps or stop completely until you purchase more
- **Cost control**: You can only use what you've paid for, making it easier to control spending

**Example**: If you purchase a $40 prepaid plan on May 1st with 10GB of data, unlimited talk and text, that $40 is immediately charged to your payment method. Your plan expires on May 28th-30th (depending on the specific plan terms), at which point you'll need to refill to maintain service.

## Postpaid Service

With postpaid service, you pay for your usage **after** you've used it. Here's how it works:

- **Payment timing**: You receive a bill at the end of your billing cycle for services already used
- **Credit check**: Typically requires a credit check during signup
- **Monthly bill**: You'll receive a detailed bill showing all charges
- **Contract options**: May offer both contract and no-contract options
- **Data overage**: If you exceed your data limit, you may incur overage charges or experience reduced speeds
- **Additional fees**: May include regulatory fees, taxes, and other surcharges not always included in advertised plan prices

**Example**: If you have a $70/month postpaid unlimited plan, your bill might actually total $78.45 after taxes and fees. If you added a one-time $10 international calling feature and made a $5 third-party purchase, your total bill would be $93.45 for that month.

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | Prepaid | Postpaid |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Payment timing | Before usage | After usage |
| Credit check | Usually no | Usually yes |
| Contract | No long-term contract | May offer contracts |
| Family plans | Limited options | More extensive options |
| International roaming | May require add-ons | Often more integrated |
| Device financing | Limited options | More options available |
| Premium features | May have fewer | Often more comprehensive |

## Managing Your Account

- **Prepaid**: Check your balance and add funds through our mobile app (available on iOS and Android), by calling customer service, or visiting a store
- **Postpaid**: View and pay your bill through our mobile app, online account portal, by phone, or set up AutoPay for automatic monthly payments

## Common Questions

**Can I switch between prepaid and postpaid?**
Yes! You can typically switch between billing types, though you may need to pay any outstanding balance and possibly undergo a credit check when moving to postpaid.

**Will my phone work with both billing types?**
Most unlocked phones work with both prepaid and postpaid plans. If you purchased your phone through us on a device payment plan, it may need to be paid off before switching to prepaid.

**Which option is better for families?**
Postpaid typically offers more comprehensive family plan options with shared data and multiple lines, while prepaid is often more focused on individual lines.

KB-1008,FAQ,Account,Multi-line account management,How Do I Manage Multiple Lines on My Account?,"# How Do I Manage Multiple Lines on My Account?

## Overview
Managing multiple lines on your account allows you to control family or business plans from a single access point. This FAQ explains the procedures for adding, removing, and modifying lines, along with important information about verification, timing, and billing implications.

## Adding New Lines

### Requirements
To add a new line to your existing account, you'll need:
- Account owner authentication (photo ID may be required)
- The account PIN/password
- Credit check for additional lines (may be waived for existing customers in good standing)
- Payment method for any applicable activation fees or device purchases

### Process
1. Log in to your account through our mobile app (available on iOS and Android) or website
2. Navigate to ""Account Management"" > ""Add a Line""
3. Select your preferred plan for the new line
4. Choose to purchase a new device or bring your own
5. Complete identity verification (typically takes 2-3 minutes)
6. Review and confirm changes

New lines are typically activated within 30 minutes to 2 hours, though system maintenance may occasionally extend this timeframe.

## Removing Lines

Only the account owner or an authorized user with management permissions can remove lines. To remove a line:

1. Access your account through the mobile app or website
2. Select ""Account Management"" > ""Manage Lines""
3. Choose the line you wish to remove
4. Select ""Remove Line"" and follow the prompts
5. Verify your identity using your PIN/password

**Important billing information:** Removing a line may trigger prorated charges or credits on your next bill. If the line being removed is under contract, early termination fees may apply. Line removal takes effect immediately, but the final bill will be generated at your regular billing cycle.

## Changing Line Permissions

You can designate different access levels for each line on your account:

- **Basic User:** Can only view their own usage and make basic changes to their line
- **Line Manager:** Can make changes to their line including plan changes and features
- **Account Manager:** Can make changes to all lines except adding/removing lines
- **Account Owner:** Full access to all account functions

To modify permissions:
1. Log in as the account owner
2. Navigate to ""Account Management"" > ""Line Settings"" > ""Permissions""
3. Select the line you wish to modify
4. Choose the appropriate permission level
5. Confirm changes with your PIN/password

Permission changes take effect immediately.

## Data Management Between Lines

### Shared Data Plans
For accounts with shared data:
- The account owner can set data usage alerts (50%, 75%, 90%, 100%)
- Data usage limits can be established for individual lines
- Data prioritization can be assigned to specific lines

To manage shared data:
1. Access ""Account Management"" > ""Data Controls""
2. Select ""Usage Controls"" to set alerts or limits
3. Changes to data controls typically take effect within 15-30 minutes

### Individual Data Plans
If lines have separate data allocations:
- Each line manages their own data usage
- The account owner can still view all usage
- Data cannot be transferred between lines with individual plans

## Billing Considerations

- Adding or removing lines mid-billing cycle will result in prorated charges
- Plan changes typically take effect on the next billing cycle unless requested immediately (which may result in prorated charges)
- Multi-line discounts are automatically applied based on the number of eligible lines
- Autopay discounts require each line to be enrolled individually

## Need More Help?

For assistance with multi-line management, contact customer support through:
- Live chat in our mobile app
- Phone support at [phone number]
- In-store support (appointment recommended)

You can also access video tutorials for multi-line management in the ""Support"" section of our mobile app or website.","troubleshooting,account,management,faq,wireless,multi-line,multi-line account management,plan",2024-12-03,"ID: KB-1008

## Understanding and Resolving Billing Discrepancies

If you've noticed an unexpected charge or potential error on your monthly bill, we're here to help you get it resolved quickly. Billing discrepancies can occur for various reasons, and most can be addressed with a few simple steps.

### Common Types of Billing Errors

* **Plan charge discrepancies**: For example, you might see a charge of $75.99 for our Unlimited Plus plan when you should be on our $65.99 Unlimited Basic plan
* **Missing promotions or discounts**: Such as a missing $10 autopay discount or family plan savings
* **Unexpected one-time fees**: Like a $35 activation fee that should have been waived
* **Duplicate charges**: For instance, being charged twice for the same $14.99 device protection plan
* **Prorated charges**: These can appear confusing when service dates don't align with billing cycles (e.g., $45.32 for 23 days of a $59.99 monthly plan)

### Steps to Resolve a Billing Error

1. **Review your bill in detail**: Log into your online account at MyAccount.com or through our mobile app (available on iOS and Android) to view an itemized breakdown of all charges.

2. **Compare with previous bills**: Check if the discrepancy is new or has appeared before.

3. **Gather supporting documentation**: If you were promised a specific promotion or discount, locate any confirmation emails or texts.

4. **Contact Customer Support**: You can:
   * Chat with us through the mobile app
   * Call 1-800-TELECOM (1-800-835-3266)
   * Visit a retail store near you

5. **Explain the issue clearly**: For example, ""I'm being charged $15.99 for Premium Data when I was told this feature would be included in my Unlimited Family Plan.""

### What Happens Next?

When you report a billing error, we'll:

1. Review your account history and plan details
2. Verify any applicable promotions or discounts
3. Make necessary adjustments to your current bill
4. Apply credits for past overcharges (typically within 1-2 billing cycles)

### Preventing Future Billing Issues

* **Set up billing alerts**: Receive notifications when your bill is ready or exceeds a certain amount
* **Review plan changes before confirming**: Understand how mid-cycle changes affect prorated charges
* **Keep confirmation numbers**: When making account changes, save the confirmation number provided
* **Check your bill monthly**: Regular reviews help catch issues early

### Still Have Questions?

If you've followed these steps and still have concerns about your bill, please contact our Billing Resolution Team at billing@telecomprovider.com or request a billing review through your online account.

KB-1013,FAQ,Billing,Payment due dates,When is my payment due?,"# When is my payment due?

Your payment is due on the date shown on your monthly bill, typically 14-21 days after your billing cycle closes. This due date remains consistent each month unless you request a change to your billing cycle.

## Understanding your payment due date

Your bill is generated on your ""bill cycle date"" - the same day each month (for example, the 5th). Your payment due date is then set approximately 2-3 weeks later (for example, the 26th). You can find both dates clearly marked at the top of your bill.

## Payment options and timing

We offer several convenient payment methods:
- **Mobile app payments**: Process immediately
- **Online account payments**: Process within 24 hours
- **Automatic payments**: Deducted on your due date
- **Phone or in-store payments**: Process immediately
- **Mail payments**: Allow 5-7 business days for delivery

## Late payment information

Payments received after 9 PM on your due date are considered late. A late fee of $5 or 1.5% of your past due balance (whichever is greater) may apply. If you're experiencing difficulty making a payment on time, please contact us before your due date to discuss payment arrangement options.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I change my due date?**
Yes! You can request a one-time due date adjustment through your online account or mobile app. You may select a new permanent due date up to 10 days earlier or later than your current one.

**Will my service be interrupted if I miss a payment?**
Service interruption typically occurs only after a bill remains unpaid for 30+ days. We'll send several reminders before any service disruption.

**How do partial payments affect my due date?**
Partial payments do not extend your due date. The remaining balance is still due by the original date to avoid late fees.

Need more help? You can view your current bill, due date, and payment history anytime in the ""Billing"" section of our mobile app (available for iOS and Android) or your online account.","payment,service,payment due dates,faq,coverage,phone,billing,dates",2024-08-27,"ID: KB-1013

# How to Resolve Billing Errors on Your Telecom Account

This guide will help you identify, report, and resolve billing errors on your account through both our mobile app and online account management portal.

## Before You Begin
- Have your account number ready (found on your bill)
- Gather any relevant billing statements showing the error
- Note specific charges you believe are incorrect

## Step 1: Review Your Bill Carefully

1. Log in to your account at [myaccount.provider.com](https://myaccount.provider.com)
2. Click on ""Billing"" or ""View Bill"" from the dashboard
3. Select the billing period in question

**Mobile App:**

2. Tap on ""Billing"" or ""Bill"" from the bottom navigation
3. Select the billing period to review

**What you'll see:** A detailed breakdown of all charges including monthly service fees, one-time charges, taxes, and credits.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If you can't access your bill online, check if you're logged into the correct account or if there are any system maintenance notices.

## Step 2: Identify and Document the Error

1. Compare the charges with your service agreement or promotional offers
2. Take screenshots or note specific line items that appear incorrect
3. Calculate the exact amount you believe is in error

**Expected outcome:** You'll have clear documentation of what charges you're disputing and why.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Some charges may appear under different names than expected. Check the ""Explanation of Charges"" section for clarification on billing terms.

## Step 3: Check for Recent Account Changes

**Online:**
1. Navigate to ""Account History"" or ""Recent Activity""
2. Review any service changes, upgrades, or one-time purchases

**Mobile App:**
1. Tap on ""Account"" or ""Profile""
2. Select ""Account History"" or ""Recent Changes""

**What you'll see:** A chronological list of account modifications that might explain new charges.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** For iOS users, you may need to tap ""See More"" to view the complete history. Android users might need to use the filter option to narrow down the timeframe.

## Step 4: Contact Customer Support

**Online:**
1. Go to ""Support"" or ""Help"" section

3. Complete the online form with your billing error details

**Mobile App:**

2. Select ""Billing Support"" or ""Report a Problem""
3. Fill out the required information

**Alternative Contact Methods:**
- Live Chat: Available through both online portal and mobile app
- Phone: Call the billing department at the number on your bill
- Retail Store: Visit in person with your documentation

**Expected outcome:** You'll receive a case number or confirmation of your billing dispute submission.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Save or screenshot your case number for future reference.

## Step 5: Track Your Resolution Progress

**Online:**
1. Go to ""Support"" or ""Help"" section
2. Select ""Check Case Status"" or ""Support History""
3. Enter your case number

**Mobile App:**
1. Tap on ""Support"" or ""Help""
2. Select ""My Cases"" or ""Support History""
3. Locate your billing dispute case

**What you'll see:** Current status of your case, estimated resolution time, and any notes from customer service representatives.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If your case doesn't appear, try refreshing the page or restarting the app. Allow 24-48 hours for new cases to appear in the system.

## Step 6: Review the Resolution

1. Once resolved, check your next bill or account for adjustments
2. Verify that credits have been applied correctly
3. Confirm any changes to your service plan or pricing

**Expected outcome:** Your bill should reflect the agreed-upon corrections, and any credits should be clearly labeled.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Credits sometimes appear on a separate bill cycle. If you don't see expected adjustments, wait for your next billing statement before contacting support again.

KB-1027,FAQ,Billing,Refund policy,What is our refund policy?,"# What is our refund policy?

We understand that billing questions can arise, and we're committed to fair and transparent refund practices. Here's everything you need to know about our refund policy:

## General Refund Guidelines

* **Service Plan Charges**: Monthly service plan fees are generally non-refundable once the billing cycle has begun. However, if you've been charged incorrectly (such as being billed for a $70/month unlimited plan when you should be on a $55/month plan), we'll refund the difference.

* **Prorated Refunds**: If you downgrade or cancel service mid-billing cycle, you may receive a prorated refund for the unused portion. For example, if you downgrade from a $60 plan to a $40 plan halfway through your billing cycle, you would receive approximately $10 back (half of the $20 difference).

* **Device Returns**: New devices can be returned within 14 days of purchase for a full refund (minus a $35 restocking fee). The device must be in like-new condition with all original packaging and accessories.

## Billing Error Refunds

If you identify an error on your bill, please contact us within 60 days. Verified billing errors are refunded in full, typically as a credit on your next bill. For example:

* Duplicate charges for the same service
* Charges for services never received
* Incorrect rate application

## Processing Timeframes

* **Bill Credits**: Refunds processed as bill credits typically appear on your next statement
* **Credit/Debit Card Refunds**: 3-5 business days to process
* **Bank Account Refunds**: 5-7 business days to process

## How to Request a Refund

You can request a refund through:

1. **Mobile App**: Navigate to Billing > Payment History > Select the charge > Request Refund
2. **Online Account**: Log in at our website, go to Billing section, and select ""Dispute Charge""
3. **Customer Service**: Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX or visit any retail location

## Additional Information

* **Prepaid Services**: Prepaid plans are generally non-refundable once service has begun
* **Add-On Features**: One-time add-ons (like international day passes at $10/day) cannot be refunded after activation
* **Taxes and Regulatory Fees**: Government-mandated fees and taxes can only be refunded if the underlying service charge is refunded

## Introduction
This guide will help you optimize your Wi-Fi network for better speed, coverage, and reliability. Follow these step-by-step instructions to diagnose and resolve common Wi-Fi issues affecting your connected devices.

## Prerequisites
Before starting optimization:
- Verify your internet service is active (check other devices or contact your provider)
- Ensure your router is powered on (look for illuminated indicator lights)
- Confirm your monthly data allowance hasn't been exceeded

## Step 1: Position Your Router Optimally
**Action:** Place your router in a central location, elevated off the floor, away from metal objects, appliances, and thick walls.

**Device variations:**
- Mesh systems: Position satellite units within range of the main router but far enough to extend coverage
- External antenna routers: Point antennas in different directions for better coverage

**Expected result:** Signal strength indicators on your devices should show improvement (more bars).

**Success indicator:** Devices in previously weak signal areas connect more reliably.

## Step 2: Select the Best Wi-Fi Channel
**Action:** Access your router's admin panel:
1. Open a web browser and enter your router's IP address (typically 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1)
2. Log in with your admin credentials
3. Locate ""Wireless Settings"" or ""Channel Settings""
4. For 2.4GHz networks, select channels 1, 6, or 11
5. For 5GHz networks, use Auto or select a channel with least interference
6. Save settings

**Device variations:**
- Most modern routers: Use ""Auto"" channel selection
- Advanced routers: Look for ""Channel Analysis"" feature

**Expected result:** Router will restart with new channel settings.

**Success indicator:** Reduced interference and improved connection stability.

## Step 3: Update Router Firmware
**Action:** 
1. Access router admin panel (as in Step 2)
2. Find ""Firmware Update"" or ""Administration"" section
3. Check for available updates
4. Download and install if available
5. Allow router to complete update and restart

**Device variations:**
- Some routers: May have companion mobile apps for updates
- ISP-provided routers: May update automatically

**Expected result:** Router will install updates and restart.

**Success indicator:** Firmware version number increases; potential performance improvements and security enhancements.

## Step 4: Optimize Security Settings
**Action:**
1. Access router admin panel
2. Locate ""Wireless Security"" settings
3. Use WPA3 if available, or WPA2-PSK (AES)
4. Create a strong password with mixed characters
5. Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
6. Save settings

**Expected result:** Devices will need to reconnect with new security settings.

**Success indicator:** More secure network with minimal performance impact.

## Step 5: Enable Quality of Service (QoS)
**Action:**
1. Access router admin panel
2. Find ""QoS"" or ""Traffic Management"" settings
3. Enable QoS feature
4. Prioritize applications based on your needs (video calls, gaming, streaming)
5. Save settings

**Device variations:**
- Basic routers: May have simple QoS on/off toggle
- Advanced routers: Allow detailed application prioritization
- Gaming routers: Have preset gaming priority profiles

**Expected result:** Network traffic will be managed according to priorities.

**Success indicator:** Smoother performance for high-priority applications, especially during heavy network usage.

## Step 6: Check for Interference Using Mobile Apps
**Action:**
1. Download a Wi-Fi analyzer app:
   - Android: ""WiFi Analyzer"" or ""Network Analyzer""
   - iOS: ""Airport Utility"" or ""NetSpot""
2. Scan your environment for competing networks
3. Identify congested channels
4. Return to Step 2 to change your channel if needed

**Expected result:** Visual representation of Wi-Fi networks and channel congestion in your area.

**Success indicator:** Identification of less congested channels for your network.

## Step 7: Consider a Mesh Network or Range Extenders
**Action:** For larger homes or persistent dead zones:
1. Research compatible mesh systems or range extenders
2. Install according to manufacturer instructions
3. Position additional units","data,technical,wireless,wifi optimization,wifi,optimization,guide,device",2024-05-29,"ID: KB-1035

KB-1038,FAQ,Account,Billing responsibility transfer,How Do I Transfer Billing Responsibility for My Account to Someone Else?,"# How Do I Transfer Billing Responsibility for My Account to Someone Else?

## Overview
Transferring billing responsibility allows you to shift financial accountability for your account to another person while maintaining the same phone number(s) and service plan(s). This process, also known as a Transfer of Ownership (TOO), requires verification from both parties and specific documentation to protect account security.

## Transfer Process

1. **Initial Verification Requirements**
   * The current account owner must initiate the transfer request
   * Both parties must have:
     - Valid government-issued photo ID
     - Social Security Number or Tax ID (for credit check purposes)
     - Email address for digital documentation

2. **Submission Methods**
   * **Online**: Log into your account at MyAccount.com or through our mobile app (available on iOS and Android)
   * **In-Store**: Visit any retail location with both parties present
   * **Customer Service**: Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX (both parties must be on the call or available for callback verification)

3. **Credit Verification**
   * The new account owner will undergo a credit check
   * May require a security deposit based on credit standing
   * Previous account history does not transfer to the new owner

## Timeframes

* **Standard Processing**: 24-72 hours after all documentation is received
* **Billing Cycle Impact**: Changes take effect at the start of the next billing cycle
* **Service Continuation**: No service interruption occurs during the transfer

## Billing Implications

* **Final Bill**: Current account owner receives a prorated final bill
* **New Billing**: New owner's first bill will be prorated from transfer date
* **Autopay Settings**: Do not transfer automatically; new owner must re-establish
* **Payment History**: Does not transfer to the new account

## Important Considerations

* **Contract Obligations**: Any remaining device payments or term commitments transfer to the new owner
* **Promotions & Discounts**: Some promotional pricing may not transfer; verify before proceeding
* **Digital Content**: Purchased content (ringtones, games, etc.) does not transfer
* **Account PINs/Passwords**: Will be reset during the transfer process
* **Family Plans**: All lines on a family plan must transfer together unless separated into individual accounts first

## After the Transfer

The new account owner should:
* Download our mobile app to manage the account

KB-1040,Procedure,Billing,Unexpected charges explanation,Procedure: Investigating and Resolving Unexpected Charges,"# Procedure: Investigating and Resolving Unexpected Charges

## Purpose
This procedure guides customer support agents through the systematic investigation and resolution of unexpected charges on customer accounts, ensuring thorough explanation while maintaining compliance with company policies.

## Procedure Steps

### Initial Assessment
1. Greet the customer professionally and acknowledge their concern about unexpected charges.
2. Verify the customer's identity using at least two authentication methods (account PIN, last 4 digits of SSN, billing address, or security questions).
3. Ask the customer to identify which specific charges they're questioning on their bill.
4. Determine if the customer is viewing charges through the mobile app, online portal, or paper bill to ensure you're both looking at the same information.

### Investigation Process
5. Access the customer's billing history in the Billing Management System (BMS).
6. Compare the current bill with previous bills to identify new or increased charges.
7. Check for recent account changes that might explain the charges:
   - Plan changes or upgrades
   - Added/removed lines
   - Device purchases or upgrades
   - Feature additions/removals
   - One-time fees or proration
8. Review usage patterns for potential overages (data, minutes, messaging).
9. Verify if any promotional credits or discounts have expired.
10. Check for third-party charges or premium services activations.

### Explanation and Resolution
11. Explain the charges to the customer in clear, non-technical language.
12. If charges are valid:
    - Explain the source of each charge
    - Reference relevant terms of service
    - Suggest plan optimization if appropriate
13. If charges are erroneous:
    - Process immediate adjustment for amounts under $50
    - Submit adjustment request for approval for amounts $50-$150
    - Escalate to supervisor for amounts exceeding $150
14. For disputed third-party charges:
    - Submit dispute form in the Third-Party Management Portal
    - Advise customer of investigation timeline (typically 3-5 business days)

### Documentation and Follow-up
15. Document all findings and actions taken in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using the ""Billing Inquiry"" category.
16. Summarize the resolution for the customer, including:
    - Explanation of all charges
    - Any adjustments made or pending
    - Expected timeline for adjustments to appear
17. Provide the customer with a reference number for the interaction.
18. Set appropriate expectations for when changes will reflect on their bill or account.
19. Offer to enable billing alerts through the mobile app or account settings to prevent future surprises.

### Escalation Path
20. Escalate to Billing Team Lead if:
    - Dispute involves charges older than 90 days
    - Multiple billing cycles are affected
    - Adjustment amount exceeds agent authority ($150)
    - Customer remains dissatisfied after explanation
21. For regulatory or legal concerns, escalate to Compliance Department via the Compliance Ticket System.

### Quality Assurance
22. After call completion, review documentation for accuracy and completeness.
23. Flag account for follow-up if promised adjustments require verification.
24. Submit case for review if the issue indicates a potential systemic billing problem.

# Procedure: Investigating and Resolving Unexpected Charges

## Purpose
This procedure guides customer support agents through the systematic investigation and resolution of unexpected charges on customer accounts, ensuring thorough explanation while maintaining compliance with company policies.

## Procedure Steps

### Initial Assessment
1. Greet the customer professionally and acknowledge their concern about unexpected charges.
2. Verify the customer's identity using at least two authentication methods (account PIN, last 4 digits of SSN, billing address, or security questions).
3. Ask the customer to identify which specific charges they're questioning on their bill.
4. Determine if the customer is viewing charges through the mobile app, online portal, or paper bill to ensure you're both looking at the same information.

### Investigation Process
5. Access the customer's billing history in the Billing Management System (BMS).
6. Compare the current bill with previous bills to identify new or increased charges.
7. Check for recent account changes that might explain the charges:
   - Plan changes or upgrades
   - Added/removed lines
   - Device purchases or upgrades
   - Feature additions/removals
   - One-time fees or proration
8. Review usage patterns for potential overages (data, minutes, messaging).
9. Verify if any promotional credits or discounts have expired.
10. Check for third-party charges or premium services activations.

### Explanation and Resolution
11. Explain the charges to the customer in clear, non-technical language.
12. If charges are valid:
    - Explain the source of each charge
    - Reference relevant terms of service
    - Suggest plan optimization if appropriate
13. If charges are erroneous:
    - Process immediate adjustment for amounts under $50
    - Submit adjustment request for approval for amounts $50-$150
    - Escalate to supervisor for amounts exceeding $150
14. For disputed third-party charges:
    - Submit dispute form in the Third-Party Management Portal
    - Advise customer of investigation timeline (typically 3-5 business days)

### Documentation and Follow-up
15. Document all findings and actions taken in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using the ""Billing Inquiry"" category.
16. Summarize the resolution for the customer, including:
    - Explanation of all charges
    - Any adjustments made or pending
    - Expected timeline for adjustments to appear
17. Provide the customer with a reference number for the interaction.
18. Set appropriate expectations for when changes will reflect on their bill or account.
19. Offer to enable billing alerts through the mobile app or account settings to prevent future surprises.

### Escalation Path
20. Escalate to Billing Team Lead if:
    - Dispute involves charges older than 90 days
    - Multiple billing cycles are affected
    - Adjustment amount exceeds agent authority ($150)
    - Customer remains dissatisfied after explanation
21. For regulatory or legal concerns, escalate to Compliance Department via the Compliance Ticket System.

### Quality Assurance
22. After call completion, review documentation for accuracy and completeness.
23. Flag account for follow-up if promised adjustments require verification.
24. Submit case for review if the issue indicates a potential systemic billing problem.

KB-1041,FAQ,Services,Device protection plans,What are Device Protection Plans and how do they work?,"# What are Device Protection Plans and how do they work?

## Overview
Device Protection Plans are optional insurance services that protect your smartphone, tablet, or other connected devices against accidental damage, loss, theft, and mechanical/electrical failures after the manufacturer's warranty expires. These plans provide peace of mind by covering repair or replacement costs that would otherwise be expensive out-of-pocket expenses.

## How Device Protection Works

1. **Enrollment**: You can add device protection when purchasing a new device or within 30 days of activation. Some plans allow enrollment during special open enrollment periods.

2. **Monthly Premium**: A monthly fee (typically $7-$15) is added to your regular bill based on your device type and protection level.

3. **Filing Claims**: When your device is damaged, lost, or stolen:
   - Submit a claim through our mobile app, online account portal, or by calling 1-800-XXX-XXXX
   - Provide details about the incident and device condition
   - Pay any applicable deductible (ranges from $29-$249 depending on device model and claim type)

4. **Resolution**: Depending on your situation, you'll receive:
   - Same-day repair at authorized service centers (where available)
   - Next-day replacement device delivery (in most areas)
   - Walk-in repair options at select retail locations

## Plan Compatibility

Our device protection plans are available for most postpaid service plans and compatible with:

- **Smartphones**: All current iOS and Android smartphones purchased from us or brought to our network
- **Tablets**: iPads, Samsung Galaxy Tabs, and other major brand tablets
- **Wearables**: Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch, and other connected wearables
- **Connected Devices**: Hotspots, laptops, and other eligible connected devices

*Note: Prepaid customers have access to our Basic Protection option only. Legacy devices over 3 years old may have limited protection options.*

## Activation Requirements

To activate device protection:
- Device must be in good working condition with no existing damage
- Enrollment must occur within 30 days of device purchase/activation (unless during open enrollment)
- You must provide proof of purchase for bring-your-own devices
- Initial eligibility verification may be required via our mobile app

## Maximizing Your Protection Plan Value

**Example 1: Screen Damage**  
Sarah accidentally dropped her iPhone 13, cracking the screen. With Premium Protection, she scheduled a same-day repair through the mobile app, paid a $29 deductible, and had her phone fixed at a local authorized repair center within hours—saving over $250 compared to out-of-warranty repair costs.

**Example 2: Lost Device**  
Michael lost his Samsung Galaxy S22 while traveling. He filed a claim through his online account, paid the $149 deductible, and received a replacement device the next day at his hotel. Without protection, he would have paid $899 for a new device.

**Example 3: Water Damage**  
Elena's tablet stopped working after a water spill. Her Basic Protection plan covered a replacement device for a $99 deductible, saving her the $429 replacement cost.

**Pro Tips:**
- Install our mobile app to enable ""Find My Device"" features for additional security
- Back up your data regularly using our cloud storage service
- Consider adding multi-device protection for family plans to save on monthly premiums

## Additional Information
- File up to 3 claims per 12-month period per device
- Deductibles reset annually
- Protection plans can be canceled at any time
- Replacements may be new or refurbished devices of similar kind and quality

KB-1045,FAQ,Billing,Taxes and regulatory fees,Why Do I See Taxes and Regulatory Fees on My Bill?,"# Why Do I See Taxes and Regulatory Fees on My Bill?

Your monthly bill includes various taxes and regulatory fees in addition to your plan charges. These are not set by us but are mandated by federal, state, and local governments. Here's a breakdown to help you understand these charges:

## Government-Required Taxes

- **Federal Universal Service Fund (USF)**: Currently 28.9% of interstate and international calls. This supports telecommunications services in schools, libraries, rural areas, and for low-income consumers.
- **State and Local Sales Tax**: Varies by location (typically 4-10% of eligible charges).
- **911 Service Fees**: Generally $0.75-$3.00 per line to fund emergency services.
- **State Universal Service Fund**: Varies by state (0-7%).

## Regulatory Fees

- **Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee**: Typically $1.50-$3.99 per line. This helps us recover costs associated with complying with government regulations.
- **Administrative Fee**: Usually $1.99-$3.99 per line. This helps offset costs related to cell site maintenance and interconnection with other carriers.

## Example Calculation

For a $70 monthly plan in a location with 6% sales tax:
- Base plan: $70.00
- Sales tax (6%): $4.20
- Federal USF (on applicable portions): ~$1.75
- 911 Fee: $1.50
- Regulatory Cost Recovery: $2.99
- Administrative Fee: $1.99
- **Total bill**: $82.43

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why did my taxes and fees change this month?**
Tax rates and regulatory fees can change quarterly. Additionally, if you changed your plan or added services, the taxable amount may have changed.

**Can I get these fees waived?**
Since these charges are mandated by government agencies or are standard administrative fees, they cannot be waived. However, our advertised ""taxes and fees included"" plans incorporate these costs into the advertised price.

**How can I see a breakdown of these charges?**
You can view a detailed breakdown of all charges in your online account under ""Billing Details"" or in the mobile app under ""Bill > View Bill Details > Taxes and Fees.""

**Do taxes and fees apply to autopay discounts?**
No, autopay discounts are applied before taxes and fees are calculated, which maximizes your savings.

KB-1049,FAQ,Account,Account pins and passwords,"What are account PINs and passwords, and how do I manage them?","# What are account PINs and passwords, and how do I manage them?

## Overview
Your account PIN and password are critical security measures that protect your telecom account from unauthorized access. While they serve similar purposes, they function differently within our systems:

- **Account PIN**: A 4-6 digit numerical code used primarily for phone verification when contacting customer service or visiting retail locations
- **Account Password**: A more complex alphanumeric credential used to access your online account and mobile app

## Setting Up or Changing Your PIN

### Initial Setup
When you first establish service, you'll create a PIN during the activation process. If you don't remember setting one, a temporary PIN may have been assigned (typically the last 4 digits of the primary account holder's SSN).

### Changing Your PIN
You can change your PIN through:
- **Mobile App**: Navigate to Account → Security → Manage PIN
- **Online Account**: Log in and select Settings → Security → Update PIN
- **Customer Service**: Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX and verify your identity to request a PIN change
- **Retail Store**: Visit with a valid government ID to update your PIN in person

PIN changes take effect immediately across all systems.

## Managing Your Account Password

### Password Requirements
- 8-20 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

### Password Changes
You can update your password through:
- **Mobile App**: Account → Security → Change Password
- **Online Account**: Settings → Security → Update Password
- **Forgotten Password**: Use the ""Forgot Password"" link on the login screen to receive a reset link via email or text

Password changes take effect immediately but may require you to log in again on all devices.

## Important Security Considerations

### Verification Requirements
- PIN changes require verification of the current PIN or alternative identity verification
- Password resets require access to your registered email or phone number
- Major account changes require both PIN verification and additional identity confirmation

### Impact on Services
- Changing your PIN will not interrupt any services
- Password changes will require re-authentication on all devices where you're logged in
- After 5 failed PIN attempts, your account may be temporarily locked for 24 hours
- After 3 failed password attempts, you may need to complete a CAPTCHA or verification step

### Billing Considerations
- Account security changes do not affect your billing cycle or charges
- If your account becomes locked due to security concerns, autopay will still process as scheduled
- For security reasons, changing your PIN or password will not stop any pending payments

## Additional Tips
- Update your security credentials every 3-6 months
- Never share your PIN or password with others
- Enable biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition) on the mobile app for added security (available on iOS 12+ and Android 8.0+)
- Consider enabling two-factor authentication for additional account protection

If you suspect unauthorized account access, contact customer service immediately at 1-800-XXX-XXXX.","payment,subscription,account,account pins and passwords,faq,roaming,pins,passwords",2024-07-04,"ID: KB-1049

- **Forgotten Password**: Use the ""Forgot Password"" link on the login screen to receive a reset link via email or text

Password changes take effect immediately but may require you to log in again on all devices.

## Important Security Considerations

### Verification Requirements
- PIN changes require verification of the current PIN or alternative identity verification
- Password resets require access to your registered email or phone number
- Major account changes require both PIN verification and additional identity confirmation

### Impact on Services
- Changing your PIN will not interrupt any services
- Password changes will require re-authentication on all devices where you're logged in
- After 5 failed PIN attempts, your account may be temporarily locked for 24 hours
- After 3 failed password attempts, you may need to complete a CAPTCHA or verification step

### Billing Considerations
- Account security changes do not affect your billing cycle or charges
- If your account becomes locked due to security concerns, autopay will still process as scheduled
- For security reasons, changing your PIN or password will not stop any pending payments

## Additional Tips
- Update your security credentials every 3-6 months
- Never share your PIN or password with others
- Enable biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition) on the mobile app for added security (available on iOS 12+ and Android 8.0+)
- Consider enabling two-factor authentication for additional account protection

If you suspect unauthorized account access, contact customer service immediately at 1-800-XXX-XXXX."

KB-1052,FAQ,Technical,Wifi optimization,How Can I Optimize My Home WiFi Network for Better Performance?,"# How Can I Optimize My Home WiFi Network for Better Performance?

## Common Issues
Poor WiFi performance can manifest as:
* Slow internet speeds
* Frequent disconnections
* ""Weak signal"" or ""Unable to connect to network"" error messages
* Buffering during streaming
* Lag during online gaming
* ""Connected but no internet access"" notifications

## Basic Optimization Steps

### 1. Position Your Router Optimally
* Place your router in a central location in your home
* Keep it elevated (on a shelf rather than the floor)
* Avoid placing near metal objects, thick walls, fish tanks, or other electronics
* Keep at least 3 feet away from other electronic devices

### 2. Update Your Router's Firmware
* Log into your router's admin panel (typically http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1)
* Look for ""Firmware Update,"" ""Router Update,"" or ""Administration"" section
* Follow on-screen instructions to check for and install updates
* Note: Your internet connection will briefly disconnect during the update

### 3. Select the Optimal WiFi Channel

**For Android devices:**
1. Download a WiFi analyzer app from Google Play Store (like ""WiFi Analyzer"" or ""Network Analyzer"")
2. Open the app and identify less congested channels
3. Log into your router's admin panel
4. Navigate to wireless settings and select a less crowded channel

**For iOS devices:**
1. Download a network analyzer app from App Store (like ""Airport Utility"" or ""Network Analyzer Pro"")

* Save your settings

### 5. Consider Your WiFi Frequency Band
* 2.4 GHz: Better range but slower speeds
* 5 GHz: Faster speeds but shorter range
* If your router is dual-band, connect:
  * Devices needing mobility to 2.4 GHz
  * Stationary devices requiring high bandwidth to 5 GHz

### 6. Secure Your Network
* Use WPA3 encryption if available (or at least WPA2)
* Create a strong, unique password
* Consider enabling MAC address filtering for additional security

## Advanced Optimization

### 1. Check for Interference
* Keep microwave ovens, cordless phones, and Bluetooth devices away from your router
* Consider changing your router's channel width settings (20MHz for 2.4GHz networks in crowded areas)

### 2. Extend Your Network if Needed
* For larger homes, consider:
  * WiFi extenders
  * Mesh network systems
  * Powerline adapters

### 3. Update Device Drivers
* Ensure your computers, phones, and tablets have the latest WiFi drivers and operating systems

## When to Contact Support
Contact our technical support team if:

* You've tried all the steps above and still experience poor connectivity
* Your router frequently restarts on its own
* You see error messages like ""DHCP configuration failure"" or ""IP address conflict""
* Your WiFi network disappears completely from the list of available networks

KB-1054,FAQ,Billing,Service interruption credits,How Do Service Interruption Credits Work on My Bill?,"# How Do Service Interruption Credits Work on My Bill?

## What is a service interruption credit?

A service interruption credit is an adjustment applied to your account when you experience a significant disruption to your telecommunications service that was caused by an issue on our network. These credits compensate you for the time you were unable to use the service you pay for.

## When am I eligible for a service interruption credit?

You may be eligible for a credit when:
- Your service was completely unavailable for more than 24 consecutive hours
- The interruption was due to a technical issue on our network (not related to your equipment, home wiring, or scheduled maintenance)
- You reported the outage to our technical support team

## How is the credit amount calculated?

The credit is typically calculated as a pro-rated portion of your monthly service charge:

```
Daily Rate = Monthly Service Charge ÷ 30 days
Credit Amount = Daily Rate × Number of Days Without Service
```

**Example:** If you pay $60/month for internet service and experienced a 3-day outage, your credit would be:
- Daily Rate: $60 ÷ 30 = $2 per day
- Credit Amount: $2 × 3 days = $6 credit

## How will the credit appear on my bill?

The credit will appear on your next bill as a line item labeled ""Service Interruption Credit"" or ""Network Outage Credit"" with the corresponding amount and date range of the affected service.

## Do I need to request this credit?

In most cases of widespread outages, we automatically apply credits to affected customers. However, if you experienced a service interruption and don't see a credit on your next bill, please contact Customer Support through:
- Our mobile app (available on iOS and Android)
- Your online account at [website]
- Customer service at [phone number]

## Are there any service interruptions that don't qualify for credits?

Credits typically don't apply to:
- Outages lasting less than 24 hours
- Scheduled maintenance (which we notify you about in advance)
- Issues with your in-home equipment or wiring
- Service interruptions caused by events beyond our control (natural disasters, power outages)
- Service suspensions due to non-payment

## Will my promotional discounts or bundle pricing be affected?

No, receiving a service interruption credit will not affect any promotional rates, discounts, or bundle pricing you currently enjoy. The credit is simply an adjustment for the specific interruption period.

## What if I have multiple services that were affected?

If you have a bundle (such as internet, TV, and phone) and all services were affected, the credit will be calculated based on the bundle price. If only one service in your bundle was affected, the credit will be proportional to that service's value within your bundle.

If you have any other questions about service interruption credits on your bill, please contact our Customer Support team.","interruption,service interruption credits,service,credits,faq,roaming,network,billing,plan",2025-01-21,"ID: KB-1054

KB-1057,FAQ,Billing,Family plan billing,How Does Family Plan Billing Work?,"# How Does Family Plan Billing Work?

Family plans allow multiple lines to share data, talk, and text under one account while typically offering savings compared to individual plans. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of how family plan billing works:

## Basic Structure of Family Plan Bills

Your monthly bill consists of:

1. **Base plan fee**: This covers the primary account holder and includes your shared data allowance
   - Example: $70/month for unlimited data base plan

2. **Line access fees**: A charge for each additional line on your account
   - Example: $20-45 per additional line depending on your plan tier

3. **Shared features**: Data, talk, and text allowances that all lines use from the same pool

4. **Individual line charges**: Any add-ons or premium services specific to each line

## Sample Family Plan Calculation

For a family of four on our Premium Unlimited plan:
- Base plan: $80/month (includes first line and unlimited shared data)
- Additional lines: $45 for the 2nd line, $25 for the 3rd line, $25 for the 4th line
- Total monthly recurring charge: $175/month

For our Essentials plan with 30GB shared data:
- Base plan: $65/month (includes first line and 30GB shared data)
- Additional lines: $35 for the 2nd line, $20 for the 3rd line, $20 for the 4th line
- Total monthly recurring charge: $140/month

## Common Questions About Family Plan Billing

**How is data usage calculated?**
All lines draw from the same data pool. You can monitor usage for each line in our mobile app (available for iOS and Android) or through your online account.

**Can I set usage limits for specific lines?**
Yes! Log into your account online or through our mobile app to set data caps for individual lines, which is especially helpful for managing children's usage.

**What happens if we exceed our shared data limit?**
For plans with data caps, you'll either:
- Experience reduced speeds for the remainder of the billing cycle
- Pay an overage fee (typically $15 per 1GB of additional data)
- Have the option to purchase a one-time data boost

**Can I add premium features to just one line?**
Absolutely. Individual lines can have their own add-ons like international calling, premium device protection, or streaming subscriptions. These charges will appear itemized under that specific line on your bill.

**How are one-time charges billed?**
One-time charges such as activation fees, device payments, or late fees appear separately on your bill and are clearly marked as non-recurring.

## Managing Your Family Plan

KB-1058,FAQ,Technical,Data throttling,What is Data Throttling and How Can I Fix Slow Data Speeds?,"# What is Data Throttling and How Can I Fix Slow Data Speeds?

## Understanding Data Throttling

Data throttling occurs when your mobile carrier temporarily reduces your data speeds after you've reached a certain threshold in your data plan. This is different from a general network slowdown and specifically affects your individual line or account.

### How to Identify If You're Being Throttled

1. **Check your data usage:**
   * **iOS:** Go to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Usage
   * **Android:** Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Data Usage (may vary by device manufacturer)

2. **Look for these indicators:**
   * Your data speeds were normal but suddenly slowed significantly
   * You can still connect to the internet, but videos buffer and websites load slowly
   * You received a text message notification about approaching or exceeding your data limit
   * The slowdown occurred near the end of your billing cycle

3. **Common error messages:**
   * ""You've used 90% of your high-speed data""
   * ""Data speeds reduced due to plan limitations""
   * ""High-speed data limit reached""

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Verify You're Being Throttled
1. Run a speed test using an app like Speedtest by Ookla (available on iOS and Android)
2. Compare your results to your plan's throttled speed (typically 128Kbps-2Mbps)
3. Check your carrier's app or website for data usage information:
   * Open your carrier's mobile app
   * Navigate to the account or data usage section
   * Look for notifications about reduced speeds or data limits

### Step 2: Potential Solutions

**If you're on a limited data plan:**
1. Purchase additional high-speed data:
   * **iOS/Android:** Open your carrier's app and look for ""Add Data"" or ""Data Boost"" options
   * Visit your account portal on the carrier website
   * Text the designated shortcode (often provided in throttling notification messages)

**If you're experiencing throttling on an unlimited plan:**
1. Check your usage to see if you've exceeded the ""premium data"" threshold (typically 22-100GB depending on carrier and plan)
2. Verify if the throttling is time-based (some carriers only throttle during network congestion)
3. Check if specific content is being throttled (some plans may limit video streaming quality)

### Step 3: Optimize Your Data Usage

1. **Connect to Wi-Fi whenever possible:**
   * **iOS:** Settings > Wi-Fi > toggle ON
   * **Android:** Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > toggle ON

2. **Enable data saver mode:**
   * **iOS:** Settings > Cellular > Low Data Mode
   * **Android:** Settings > Network & Internet > Data Saver

3. **Adjust app settings:**
   * Set video streaming apps to lower quality (Netflix, YouTube, etc.)
   * Disable auto-play features in social media apps
   * Turn off background app refresh:
     * **iOS:** Settings > General > Background App Refresh
     * **Android:** Settings > Apps > [select app] > Data usage > Background data

## When to Contact Customer Support

Contact customer support if:

* You're experiencing throttling but haven't exceeded your data limit
* Your speeds remain slow after purchasing additional data
* You're on an unlimited plan and being throttled below the advertised throttled speed
* The throttling continues into your new billing cycle
* You need help understanding your plan's specific data policies

**Before contacting support, have ready:**
* Your account number and PIN/password
* Screenshots of speed tests showing the reduced speeds
* Information about when the throttling began
* Your current billing cycle dates
* Details about any error messages received

**Contact options:**
* Call customer service: [Carrier's support number]
* Live chat: Available through the carrier's mobile app or website
* Social media: Many carriers offer support via Twitter or Facebook direct messages
* Visit a retail store: For in-person troubleshooting assistance","technical,faq,wireless,mobile,throttling,data,data throttling,plan",2025-01-31,"ID: KB-1058

3. Check your carrier's app or website for data usage information:
   * Open your carrier's mobile app
   * Navigate to the account or data usage section
   * Look for notifications about reduced speeds or data limits

### Step 2: Potential Solutions

**If you're on a limited data plan:**
1. Purchase additional high-speed data:
   * **iOS/Android:** Open your carrier's app and look for ""Add Data"" or ""Data Boost"" options
   * Visit your account portal on the carrier website
   * Text the designated shortcode (often provided in throttling notification messages)

**If you're experiencing throttling on an unlimited plan:**
1. Check your usage to see if you've exceeded the ""premium data"" threshold (typically 22-100GB depending on carrier and plan)
2. Verify if the throttling is time-based (some carriers only throttle during network congestion)
3. Check if specific content is being throttled (some plans may limit video streaming quality)

### Step 3: Optimize Your Data Usage

1. **Connect to Wi-Fi whenever possible:**
   * **iOS:** Settings > Wi-Fi > toggle ON
   * **Android:** Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > toggle ON

2. **Enable data saver mode:**
   * **iOS:** Settings > Cellular > Low Data Mode
   * **Android:** Settings > Network & Internet > Data Saver

3. **Adjust app settings:**
   * Set video streaming apps to lower quality (Netflix, YouTube, etc.)
   * Disable auto-play features in social media apps
   * Turn off background app refresh:
     * **iOS:** Settings > General > Background App Refresh
     * **Android:** Settings > Apps > [select app] > Data usage > Background data

## When to Contact Customer Support

Contact customer support if:

* You're experiencing throttling but haven't exceeded your data limit
* Your speeds remain slow after purchasing additional data
* You're on an unlimited plan and being throttled below the advertised throttled speed
* The throttling continues into your new billing cycle
* You need help understanding your plan's specific data policies

**Before contacting support, have ready:**
* Your account number and PIN/password
* Screenshots of speed tests showing the reduced speeds
* Information about when the throttling began
* Your current billing cycle dates
* Details about any error messages received

**Contact options:**
* Call customer service: [Carrier's support number]
* Live chat: Available through the carrier's mobile app or website

## What Is a Mobile Hotspot?

A mobile hotspot transforms your smartphone into a portable Wi-Fi router, allowing you to share your cellular data connection with other devices like laptops, tablets, or other smartphones. This feature is built into most modern smartphones and is also available as dedicated hotspot devices from most carriers.

## Getting Started with Mobile Hotspot

### Basic Setup on Smartphones

**For Android devices:**
1. Open Settings
2. Tap ""Connections"" or ""Network & Internet""
3. Select ""Hotspot & Tethering"" or ""Mobile Hotspot""
4. Toggle the switch to turn on the hotspot
5. Configure your hotspot name (SSID) and password for security

**For iOS devices:**
1. Open Settings
2. Tap ""Personal Hotspot""
3. Toggle to enable ""Allow Others to Join""
4. Note the Wi-Fi password displayed (or tap to change it)

### Dedicated Hotspot Devices
If you frequently need to connect multiple devices or require more reliable connections:
1. Purchase a dedicated mobile hotspot from your carrier
2. Follow the device-specific setup instructions (typically involves powering on and connecting to the default network)
3. Use the companion app (like the AT&T Mobile Hotspot app or Verizon My Mobile Hotspot Manager) to manage settings

## Compatibility and Connection Methods

### Wi-Fi Connection
* Most common method
* Works with virtually any Wi-Fi-enabled device
* Typically supports 5-10 device connections simultaneously (varies by phone model and carrier)

### USB Tethering
* Connect your phone directly to a computer via USB cable
* More stable connection with less battery drain
* Available on most Android devices and iPhones

### Bluetooth Tethering
* Uses less power than Wi-Fi hotspot
* Slower speeds but sufficient for basic browsing
* Limited to one connected device at a time on most phones

## Managing Data Usage and Optimization

### Monitor Your Usage
* Track data consumption through your carrier's mobile app (My Verizon, myAT&T, T-Mobile app, etc.)
* Set data alerts in your account settings
* Use your phone's built-in data tracking tools

### Battery Optimization
* Keep your phone plugged in when using hotspot for extended periods
* Lower your screen brightness
* Close unnecessary apps running in the background
* Consider using USB tethering instead of Wi-Fi hotspot for longer sessions

### Speed Optimization
* Position your phone in an area with strong cellular signal
* Reduce the number of connected devices
* If available, use 5GHz band instead of 2.4GHz for less interference (on supported devices)

## Advanced Features for Power Users

### Band Selection
On some Android devices:
1. Access developer options
2. Find ""Mobile data preferred network type""
3. Select the fastest available network (5G/LTE)

### MAC Filtering
For enhanced security:
1. Access hotspot settings
2. Look for ""Allowed devices"" or ""MAC filter""
3. Add the MAC addresses of only the devices you want to allow

### QoS (Quality of Service) Settings
Available on some dedicated hotspots and advanced phones:
1. Access hotspot settings
2. Look for ""QoS"" or ""Traffic prioritization""
3. Prioritize specific types of traffic (video, gaming, etc.)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Problems
* Restart your hotspot feature
* Ensure you haven't reached your carrier's hotspot data limit
* Try toggling airplane mode on and off
* Check for carrier network outages in your area

### Speed Issues
* Check your current signal strength
* Move to a location with better coverage
* Reduce the number of connected devices
* Verify you haven't been throttled due to data cap limits

## Carrier-Specific Considerations

Most major carriers include hotspot data in their plans, but with varying limitations:
* Some plans include unlimited phone data but limited hotspot data
* Premium unlimited plans may include more hotspot data at high speeds
* After reaching hotspot data caps, speeds are typically reduced to 3G or 2G levels
* Check your specific plan details in your carrier's mobile app or online account

## Security Best Practices

* Always use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption (default on modern devices)

KB-1066,FAQ,Billing,Taxes and regulatory fees,Why are there taxes and regulatory fees on my bill?,"# Why are there taxes and regulatory fees on my bill?

Your monthly bill includes various taxes and regulatory fees that we're required by law to collect and remit to government agencies. These charges aren't set by us and we don't profit from them, but we're obligated to include them on your bill.

## Types of taxes and fees you might see

**Government taxes:**
* State and local sales tax (typically 4-9% depending on your location)
* Municipal utility taxes
* 911 service fees (usually $0.75-$3.00 per line)

**Regulatory fees:**
* Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF) - currently 28.9% of interstate and international calls
* Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) fee
* Number portability fees (typically $0.35 per line)
* Regulatory Cost Recovery fee

## How these charges are calculated

These charges vary based on:

1. **Your location** - Different states, counties, and cities have different tax rates. For example, if you live in Chicago, you'll pay Illinois state taxes (7%), Cook County taxes (1.75%), and Chicago city taxes (9%), while someone in rural Illinois might pay significantly less.

2. **Your plan type** - Some taxes apply differently to wireless vs. home internet services. For instance, a family plan with 4 lines at $40/line might have the 911 fee applied to each line ($1.50 × 4 = $6.00 total).

3. **Your usage** - Some fees are calculated as a percentage of specific services you use.

## Common questions

**Q: Why did my taxes and fees increase this month?**
Tax rates and regulatory fees change periodically. Government agencies may increase rates, or you might have changed your service address to an area with higher local taxes.

**Q: Can I see a breakdown of these charges?**
Yes! Log into your account through our mobile app or website. Under ""Billing,"" select your most recent bill and tap ""View bill details"" to see an itemized list of all taxes and fees.

**Q: Are these charges the same for all carriers?**
Generally yes. While the presentation on bills may differ, all carriers in your area must collect the same government-mandated taxes and fees.

**Q: Can I avoid paying these fees?**
Unfortunately, no. These are government-mandated charges that all telecommunications providers must collect by law.

**Need more help?** You can chat with a billing specialist through our mobile app or call customer service at the number on your bill for specific questions about the taxes and fees on your account.","troubleshooting,taxes and regulatory fees,taxes,fees,service,faq,roaming,billing,regulatory",2025-05-08,"ID: KB-1066

## General Refund Policy

Refunds are available for certain charges on your account under specific circumstances:

KB-1070,FAQ,Billing,Taxes and regulatory fees,Why do I see taxes and regulatory fees on my bill?,"# Why do I see taxes and regulatory fees on my bill?

Your monthly bill includes various taxes and regulatory fees that we're required to collect and remit to government agencies. These charges aren't part of our revenue but are mandated by federal, state, and local authorities.

## Common taxes and fees you might see:

- **Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF)**: Currently calculated at approximately 28.9% of interstate and international calls and services. This fee helps provide affordable telecommunications services to schools, libraries, rural healthcare providers, and low-income consumers.

- **State and Local Sales Tax**: Varies by location (typically 4-10% of applicable charges). For example, if your service costs $50 and your local sales tax is 6%, you'll see a $3 charge.

- **911 Service Fee**: Typically $0.75-$3.00 per line per month, depending on your location. This supports emergency response services in your area.

- **Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee**: Usually $1.50-$3.25 per line. This helps us recover costs associated with complying with government regulations.

- **Administrative Fee**: Typically $1.99-$3.99 per line. This helps offset costs we incur from interconnecting with other carriers and cell site rental fees.

## Important things to know:

- Taxes and fees can change quarterly or annually based on government requirements.
- Moving to a new address, even within the same city, might change your tax amounts.
- Family plans with multiple lines will have per-line fees applied to each line.
- Taxes are calculated on post-discount amounts if you receive service discounts.

## How to view a breakdown of your taxes and fees:

1. **Mobile app**: Sign in to your account, select ""Billing,"" then ""View bill details"" and scroll to ""Taxes and fees""
2. **Online account**: Log in at our website, navigate to ""Billing history,"" select your most recent bill, and expand the ""Taxes and fees"" section
3. **Paper bill**: Look for the ""Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges"" section

If you have specific questions about any charge on your bill, our customer service team can provide a detailed explanation. You can also visit our website's tax calculator tool to estimate taxes and fees for your specific location and plan.","troubleshooting,account,taxes and regulatory fees,taxes,fees,faq,support,billing,regulatory",2025-02-03,"ID: KB-1070

KB-1071,FAQ,Billing,Prorated billing,What is prorated billing and why do I see partial charges on my bill?,"# What is prorated billing and why do I see partial charges on my bill?

## Understanding Prorated Billing

Prorated billing occurs when you're charged only for the portion of your billing cycle that you actually used a service. This typically happens when you make changes to your account mid-billing cycle, such as:

- Activating a new line
- Upgrading or downgrading your plan
- Adding or removing features
- Canceling a service

Rather than charging you the full monthly rate, we calculate a daily rate and multiply it by the number of days you used the service in that billing cycle.

## How Prorated Charges Are Calculated

We calculate prorated charges using this formula:

```
Prorated Charge = (Monthly Rate ÷ Days in Billing Cycle) × Days of Service Used
```

### Example 1: Adding a New Line

Let's say you add a new line on the 15th day of your 30-day billing cycle with a plan that costs $60/month:

```
$60 ÷ 30 days = $2 per day
$2 × 15 days remaining = $30 prorated charge
```

Your bill would show a $30 charge for that new line instead of the full $60.

### Example 2: Upgrading Your Plan

If you upgrade from a $50/month plan to an $80/month plan on day 20 of a 30-day billing cycle:

```
Original plan: $50 ÷ 30 days = $1.67 per day
$1.67 × 20 days = $33.40 (charge for days on original plan)

New plan: $80 ÷ 30 days = $2.67 per day
$2.67 × 10 days = $26.70 (charge for days on new plan)
```

Your bill would show a credit for the unused portion of your original plan and charges for both the days you used the original plan ($33.40) and the days you used the new plan ($26.70).

## How to Identify Prorated Charges on Your Bill

Prorated charges typically appear on your bill with:
- A note indicating ""prorated"" or ""partial month charge""
- The specific date range for which the charge applies
- The daily rate used for calculation

You can view these details by logging into your online account through our website or mobile app (available for both iOS and Android).

## Frequently Asked Questions About Prorated Billing

**Will I be notified about prorated charges in advance?**
Yes, when you make any change that results in prorated billing, you'll receive an estimate of the charges before confirming the change.

**Do all services get prorated?**
Most recurring monthly charges are prorated, including plan fees and add-on features. One-time fees (like activation fees) and some promotional items may not be prorated.

**What if my billing cycle changes?**
If your billing date changes, you may see a longer or shorter bill for that transition period, with charges adjusted accordingly.

KB-1077,FAQ,Billing,Prorated billing,What is prorated billing and how does it affect my monthly charges?,"# What is prorated billing and how does it affect my monthly charges?

Prorated billing occurs when charges are calculated based on partial billing periods rather than full months. This typically happens when you make account changes mid-billing cycle, such as activating a new line, upgrading your plan, or canceling service.

## How prorated billing works

When you make a change to your account between billing cycles, we calculate your charges based on the exact number of days you used each service. For example:

- **If you upgrade your plan:** You'll be charged for your old plan from the start of your billing cycle until the change date, and for your new plan from the change date until the end of your billing cycle.
- **If you add a new line:** You'll be charged only for the days the line was active, not the full month.
- **If you cancel service:** You'll be charged only for the days your service was active before cancellation.

## Example calculation

Let's say:
- Your monthly plan costs $60
- Your billing cycle runs from the 1st to the 30th of each month
- You upgrade to an $80 plan on the 15th

Your bill would show:
- $30 for the $60 plan (15 days ÷ 30 days × $60)
- $40 for the $80 plan (15 days ÷ 30 days × $80)
- Total: $70 for that month

## Viewing prorated charges on your bill

Prorated charges appear as separate line items on your bill. You can view a detailed breakdown by:
- Logging into your online account at our website
- Using our mobile app (available for iOS and Android)
- Checking the ""Charges and Credits"" section of your paper bill

## Common questions about prorated billing

**Will taxes and fees also be prorated?**
Yes, taxes and fees associated with your service will also be prorated based on the number of days in each service period.

**Why is my first bill higher than expected?**
Your first bill often includes prorated charges for the partial month plus charges for your first full month of service in advance.

**Do device installment plans get prorated?**
No, device installment payments remain the same each month regardless of service changes.

KB-1078,FAQ,Billing,Billing cycle changes,How Will a Change to My Billing Cycle Affect My Account?,"# How Will a Change to My Billing Cycle Affect My Account?

When your billing cycle changes, you'll see adjustments on your next bill that might look confusing at first. Here's a comprehensive explanation of what happens and what to expect.

## What happens when my billing cycle changes?

When your billing cycle date changes, your next bill will include:

1. **Prorated charges** for the partial period between your old and new billing dates
2. **Regular monthly charges** for your upcoming full billing cycle

## How are prorated charges calculated?

Prorated charges are calculated using this formula:
* (Monthly plan cost ÷ Days in month) × Number of days in partial period

**Example:** 
If you have a $60 monthly plan and your billing date changes from the 15th to the 25th, you'll be charged for those 10 days:
* ($60 ÷ 30) × 10 = $20 prorated charge

## Will my data allowances be prorated too?

Yes. If you have a 10GB monthly data plan, and your billing cycle changes to cover 10 days in a 30-day month:
* (10GB ÷ 30) × 10 = 3.33GB data allowance for the partial period

## Common scenarios that cause billing cycle changes:

* Changing your rate plan
* Adding a new line to a family account
* Requesting a specific billing date
* Account transfers or ownership changes

## Will I be notified before my billing cycle changes?

You'll receive notification via email and/or text message before any billing cycle change takes effect. You can also check your upcoming billing date anytime in our mobile app (iOS/Android) or your online account portal.

## What if my bill seems incorrect after a cycle change?

If your bill seems higher than expected after a cycle change, remember it likely includes:
* Charges for your previous full month
* Prorated charges for the partial period
* Full charges for your upcoming month

If you've reviewed these components and still believe there's an error, please contact Customer Support through the mobile app, online chat, or by calling the number on your bill.

## Can I choose my billing date?

Yes, in most cases you can request a specific billing date through your online account or by contacting Customer Support. Some restrictions may apply depending on your plan type.","account,billing cycle changes,faq,phone,billing,changes,cycle",2024-10-01,"ID: KB-1078

KB-1083,FAQ,Billing,Credit application,What is a credit application and how does it affect my account?,"# What is a credit application and how does it affect my account?

A credit application is a process we use to evaluate your financial history before establishing service or making significant changes to your account. When you apply for a new line, upgrade your device with financing, or request certain premium services, we conduct a credit check to determine your eligibility and any required deposits.

## How the credit application process works:

1. **Application submission**: When you request new service or significant account changes, we'll ask for personal information including your name, address, Social Security Number, and date of birth.

2. **Credit check**: We'll perform a ""soft pull"" credit check, which doesn't impact your credit score, to evaluate your payment history with other companies.

3. **Decision**: Based on your credit history, we'll determine:
   - Your eligibility for service
   - Any required security deposit (typically $50-$500 per line)
   - Your device financing limit (from $0 to $1,500+)
   - Available plan options

## Example of how credit affects charges:

**Good credit scenario**: 
- No security deposit required
- Eligible for premium unlimited plan ($80/month)
- Device financing up to $1,200 (e.g., $50/month for 24 months for a flagship phone)

**Limited credit scenario**:
- $150 security deposit required (refundable after 12 months of on-time payments)
- Eligible for standard plans only ($60/month)
- Device financing limited to $600 (or higher down payment required)

## Frequently asked follow-up questions:

**Will applying affect my credit score?**
Our initial credit check is a ""soft pull"" that doesn't affect your credit score. However, if you proceed with device financing, we may perform a ""hard pull"" which could temporarily impact your score.

**Can I check my eligibility before applying?**
You can use our pre-qualification tool in our mobile app or website (My Account → Pre-qualify) to get an estimate without a formal credit check.

**What if I'm denied service based on my credit?**
You can still get service with a prepaid plan that doesn't require a credit check. Visit the ""Prepaid Plans"" section in our app or website to explore these options.

**How can I improve my credit standing with your company?**
Making on-time payments for 12 consecutive months will improve your account standing, potentially qualifying you for deposit refunds and higher device financing limits at your next upgrade.

Redirects all incoming calls to another number until manually deactivated.

### Conditional Call Forwarding
Forwards calls only under specific circumstances:
- **Busy Call Forwarding**: Redirects calls when you're on another call
- **No Answer Call Forwarding**: Forwards calls after a preset number of rings
- **Unreachable Call Forwarding**: Activates when your device is turned off or out of service area

### Selective Call Forwarding
Allows you to forward calls only from specific numbers while handling other calls normally.

## Setting Up Call Forwarding

### Basic Setup Using Dial Codes
Most carriers support these universal codes:
- Activate all call forwarding: **\*72** followed by the 10-digit forwarding number
- Deactivate all call forwarding: **\*73**
- Busy call forwarding: **\*90** + forwarding number
- No answer call forwarding: **\*92** + forwarding number
- Unreachable call forwarding: **\*94** + forwarding number

### Setup Through Mobile Apps
1. Open your carrier's mobile app (available on iOS and Android)
2. Navigate to ""Call Settings"" or ""Call Management""
3. Select ""Call Forwarding"" options
4. Choose your preferred forwarding type and enter the destination number

### Setup Through Online Account Management
1. Log in to your carrier's website account portal
2. Navigate to ""Services"" or ""Features""
3. Locate ""Call Management"" or ""Call Features""
4. Configure call forwarding settings as needed

## Device-Specific Instructions

### Android
1. Open the Phone app
2. Tap the three-dot menu and select ""Settings""
3. Tap ""Calls"" or ""Call Settings""
4. Select ""Call Forwarding""

# What are the requirements for porting my number to another carrier?

When you request to transfer your phone number to a different service provider (known as a ""port-out""), specific requirements must be met to ensure a smooth transition and protect your account security.

## Account Verification Requirements

To initiate a port-out request, you'll need to provide the following information to your new carrier:

- **Account number**: Found on your monthly bill, in your online account dashboard, or in our mobile app (Menu > Account > Account Details)
- **Account PIN/password**: Your account security code
- **Account holder's name**: Exactly as it appears on your account
- **Billing address**: The address associated with your account
- **Last 4 digits of SSN or Tax ID**: For additional security verification

## Important Timeframes

- **Mobile numbers**: Typically complete within 24-48 hours
- **Landline numbers**: May take 5-7 business days
- **Business numbers**: Can take 7-10 business days depending on complexity

## Billing and Service Impacts

- Your service with us will remain active until the port is completed
- You will be billed for service through the completion date of the port
- Any remaining device payments or contract obligations will be included in your final bill
- Early termination fees may apply if you're under contract

## Additional Considerations

- **Account status**: Your account must be in good standing with no past-due balances
- **Device compatibility**: Ensure your device is compatible with your new carrier's network
- **Number eligibility**: Some promotional or specialized numbers may not be eligible for porting
- **Service interruption**: Brief service interruption (typically less than 30 minutes) may occur during the transition

## Managing Your Port-Out Request

You can check the status of your port-out request through:
- Our mobile app (iOS/Android): Navigate to Menu > Account > Transfer Status
- Online account management portal: Log in and select ""Number Transfer Status""
- Customer support: Contact us at 1-800-XXX-XXXX for assistance

If you believe an unauthorized port-out has been requested, contact our fraud department immediately at 1-888-XXX-XXXX."

KB-1107,FAQ,Billing,Payment arrangements,How Do Payment Arrangements Work?,"# How Do Payment Arrangements Work?

## Overview
A payment arrangement allows you to split an overdue balance into manageable installments when you're unable to pay your bill in full. This flexible option helps you avoid service interruption while catching up on payments.

## Setting Up a Payment Arrangement

You can establish a payment arrangement through several convenient methods:
- In your online account portal (under ""Billing"" → ""Payment Options"")
- Through our mobile app (tap ""Billing"" → ""Need help paying?"")
- By calling our customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
- By visiting any of our retail locations

## How Payment Arrangements Work

When you set up a payment arrangement, you'll:
1. Make an initial down payment (typically 25-50% of your outstanding balance)
2. Choose a schedule to pay the remaining balance (usually 2-4 installments)
3. Continue paying your regular monthly bill on time

### Example Scenario
If you have an overdue balance of $200:
- Initial down payment: $50 (25%)
- Remaining balance: $150
- Payment schedule: 3 monthly installments of $50 each
- These installment payments will appear as separate line items on your next three bills, labeled ""Payment Arrangement Installment""

## Eligibility Requirements

Payment arrangements are available to customers who:
- Have had active service for at least 3 months
- Haven't missed more than 2 payments in the past 12 months
- Haven't broken a previous payment arrangement within the last 6 months

## Important Considerations

- **Late payments**: Missing any installment payment may result in immediate service suspension and require full payment of the remaining balance
- **Early payoff**: You can pay off your arrangement early with no penalties
- **Multiple arrangements**: Generally, only one active payment arrangement is permitted at a time
- **Fees**: There is no fee to establish a payment arrangement

## Managing Your Payment Arrangement

Track your payment arrangement status:
- **iOS/Android app**: View under ""Payment History"" → ""Payment Plan""
- **Online account**: Check ""Billing Summary"" → ""Payment Arrangements""
- **Text updates**: Opt in for SMS reminders before each installment due date

## Need Additional Help?

If you're experiencing ongoing financial hardship, we offer additional assistance programs that may better suit your needs. Please contact our Customer Care team to discuss options such as:
- Hardship programs
- Seasonal payment plans
- Budget billing options

- Account PIN or password
- The phone number(s) you wish to port
- The account holder's name exactly as it appears on the account

## Timeframes for Port Completion

- **Mobile numbers:** Typically complete within 1-3 business days
- **Landline numbers:** May take 5-10 business days
- **Complex ports** (multiple lines or business accounts): May require additional time

- You will be billed for service through the completion date of the port
- Any remaining device payments or term commitments will be included in your final bill
- Early termination fees may apply if you're under contract

- Mobile device unlock may be required before porting to ensure full functionality with your new carrier
- Back up any voicemails, contacts, or text messages before porting as these will not transfer automatically

For assistance with port-out procedures, please contact Customer Support through the mobile app, online chat, or by calling the number on your bill.","account,faq,requirements,telecom,port-out requirements,roaming,voice,port-out",2024-09-23,"ID: KB-1108

KB-1113,FAQ,Billing,Refund policy,What is our refund policy?,"# What is our refund policy?

We understand that billing questions can arise, and we're committed to fair and transparent refund practices. Here's everything you need to know about our refund policy:

## General Refund Guidelines

* **Service Plan Charges**: Monthly service plan fees are generally non-refundable once the billing cycle has begun. However, if you've been charged incorrectly (such as being billed $79.99 for a Premium plan when you're subscribed to the $59.99 Standard plan), we'll refund the difference promptly.

* **Prorated Refunds**: If you downgrade or cancel your service mid-billing cycle, you may receive a prorated refund for the unused portion. For example, if you downgrade from a $70 plan to a $50 plan on day 15 of a 30-day billing cycle, you would receive approximately $10 back (50% of the $20 difference).

* **Equipment Returns**: Returned devices are eligible for refunds within 14 days of purchase, provided they're in original condition with all accessories. A $35 restocking fee may apply unless the equipment was defective.

## Disputing Charges

If you believe you've been incorrectly charged, please contact us within 60 days of the billing date. You can:
* Submit a dispute through our mobile app (tap Account → Billing → Dispute Charge)
* Contact customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
* Visit any retail location with your bill and ID

## Processing Timeframes

* **Credit/Debit Card Refunds**: 3-5 business days to appear on your statement
* **Bill Credits**: Applied to your next billing cycle
* **Check Refunds**: Processed within 14 business days for amounts over $100 that cannot be refunded to the original payment method

## Common Refund Scenarios

**One-time Charges**: Accidental purchases like premium content or third-party services may be eligible for a one-time courtesy refund. For example, if you accidentally purchased a $9.99 movie rental, we may refund this as a one-time courtesy.

**Service Outages**: For significant service outages (typically 24+ hours), credits are automatically applied based on the duration and affected services. For instance, a two-day outage might result in a credit of approximately $4 (calculated as $60 monthly plan ÷ 30 days × 2 days).

**Plan Changes**: When switching to a lower-priced plan, the difference is typically applied as a credit to your next bill rather than processed as a refund.

## Still have questions?

You can check your refund status anytime by logging into your online account at www.ourcompany.com/myaccount or through our mobile app (available for iOS and Android). For specific questions about your refund, our customer support team is available 24/7 to assist you.","refund,service,refund policy,faq,telecom,mobile,policy,billing",2025-03-08,"ID: KB-1113

KB-1118,FAQ,Billing,Prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?,"# What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?

Prepaid and postpaid are two different ways to pay for your mobile service, each with unique billing processes, payment timing, and features.

## Prepaid Service

With prepaid service, you pay for your usage **before** you use it. Here's how it works:

- **Pay upfront**: You purchase a set amount of service (talk, text, data) before using it
- **No credit check required**: Since you pay in advance, we don't need to verify your credit history
- **No monthly bill**: Instead of receiving a bill, you'll get low balance notifications
- **No overage charges**: When you reach your limit, service stops unless you add more funds
- **Flexible payment timing**: Add funds whenever needed—weekly, monthly, or as you go

**Example**: With our $40 prepaid plan, you pay $40 today and immediately receive 10GB of data, unlimited talk and text for 30 days. When your balance runs low (around day 25), you'll receive notifications to refill your account.

## Postpaid Service

With postpaid service, you pay for your usage **after** you've used it. Here's how it works:

- **Monthly billing cycle**: You receive a bill for the previous month's service
- **Credit check required**: We verify your credit history during signup
- **Potential overage charges**: If you exceed your plan limits, additional charges appear on your next bill
- **Auto-pay options**: Set up automatic payments from your bank account or credit card
- **Family plans available**: Easily add multiple lines to a single account with shared data

**Example**: With our $50 postpaid unlimited plan, you use service throughout the month, and around the 15th of the following month, you'll receive a bill for $50 plus any premium services you used (like international calls at $0.25/minute) and applicable taxes/fees.

## Common Questions

**Which is more economical?**
- Prepaid plans often have lower base rates but fewer perks
- Postpaid plans may include benefits like free streaming subscriptions or device insurance
- Compare total costs based on your specific usage patterns

**Can I keep my number if I switch between prepaid and postpaid?**
Yes! Your phone number can be transferred between our prepaid and postpaid services at any time.

**How do I manage my account?**
Both prepaid and postpaid customers can manage their accounts through:
- Our mobile app (available on iOS and Android)
- Online account portal at our website
- Customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX

**What happens if I miss a payment?**
- Prepaid: Service stops until you add more funds
- Postpaid: Late fees may apply, and service may be suspended after 30 days

Need more help understanding which option is best for you? Chat with us in our mobile app or call customer service for a personalized recommendation based on your usage patterns.","troubleshooting,account,prepaid,differences,faq,postpaid,prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,coverage,billing",2024-09-23,"ID: KB-1118

2. Verify the customer's identity using at least two authentication methods (account PIN, last 4 digits of SSN, billing address, or security questions).
3. Document the call/interaction in the customer relationship management (CRM) system, creating a dispute case with a unique reference number.
4. Ask the customer to identify the specific charge(s) being disputed, including the date and amount.

### Charge Investigation
5. Review the customer's billing history in the billing system to locate the disputed charge(s).
6. Determine the charge category (one-time fee, recurring charge, third-party charge, overage, etc.).
7. Check for any notes, service changes, or previous disputes in the account history that may be relevant.
8. Verify if the customer was notified about the charge through any communication channels (text, email, app notification).

### Resolution Paths

#### For Clear Billing Errors
9. If the charge is clearly erroneous (duplicate charge, service not provided, mathematical error):
   a. Process an immediate credit if under $50.

   b. Compare with historical usage trends.
   c. Check for any network issues or outages during the disputed period.
15. Demonstrate to the customer how to monitor usage through the mobile app (iOS/Android) or online account portal.

KB-1129,FAQ,Technical,Data throttling,What is Data Throttling and How Can I Resolve Slow Data Speeds?,"# What is Data Throttling and How Can I Resolve Slow Data Speeds?

## Understanding Data Throttling

Data throttling occurs when your mobile carrier temporarily reduces your data speeds after you've reached a certain threshold of data usage during your billing cycle. This is different from a general network slowdown and specifically affects your individual line or account.

## How to Identify if You're Being Throttled

1. **Check your data usage:**
   * **iOS:** Go to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Usage
   * **Android:** Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Data Usage (menu names may vary by device manufacturer)

2. **Look for these indicators:**
   * Your data speeds were normal but suddenly slowed significantly
   * You can still connect to the internet, but streaming, downloading, or browsing is much slower
   * The slowdown occurred after using a substantial amount of data this billing cycle
   * You received a text message notification about approaching or exceeding your data limit

3. **Common messages you might receive:**
   * ""You've used 75% of your high-speed data""
   * ""You've reached your high-speed data limit for this cycle""
   * ""Your data speeds will be reduced until [date]""

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Confirm if you're actually being throttled
Run a speed test using a reliable app like Speedtest by Ookla:
* **iOS/Android:** Download from App Store/Google Play Store and run a test
* Compare your current speeds with your typical speeds (below 1-2 Mbps typically indicates throttling)

### 2. Check your data plan and usage
* Log into your account through our mobile app or website
* Navigate to ""Data Usage"" or ""Plan Details""
* Verify if you've exceeded your high-speed data allocation
* Note when your billing cycle resets

### 3. Try these potential fixes

**If you have a limited data plan:**
* Connect to Wi-Fi whenever possible
* Purchase a data add-on through the app or by texting ADD DATA to 12345
* Consider upgrading to a plan with more high-speed data

**If you have an unlimited plan with priority data:**
* Check if you've exceeded your priority data threshold (typically 22-50GB depending on your plan)
* Wait until your billing cycle resets for speeds to return to normal
* Purchase a Priority Data Boost if available on your plan

**If throttling seems incorrect:**
* Restart your device by powering it off completely and turning it back on
* Toggle Airplane Mode on for 30 seconds, then off
* Reset network settings:
  * **iOS:** Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings
  * **Android:** Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth

## When to Contact Customer Support

Contact our support team if:
* You're experiencing throttling but haven't exceeded your data limits
* You received no notification about reaching data limits
* Your speeds remain extremely slow (under 0.5 Mbps) even when throttled
* You've purchased additional data but speeds haven't improved after 2 hours
* Your account shows incorrect data usage information

**Contact us through:**
* Our mobile app's chat feature
* Call customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
* Visit a retail store location

Before contacting support, please have the following information ready:
* Your account number or phone number
* The date when you first noticed the throttling
* Screenshots of your data usage from your device settings
* Results from a recent speed test

## Preventing Future Throttling

* Set up data usage alerts in our mobile app

KB-1136,FAQ,Billing,Prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?,"# What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?

Prepaid and postpaid are two different ways to pay for your mobile service, each with unique features and benefits that might better suit your needs.

## Prepaid Service

With prepaid service, you pay for your usage **before** you use it. Here's how it works:

- **Pay upfront**: You purchase a set amount of service (talk, text, data) before using it
- **No credit check**: Generally doesn't require a credit check to sign up
- **No monthly bill**: Instead of receiving a bill, you simply ""reload"" or ""top-up"" your account when needed
- **No overage charges**: When you run out of data or minutes, service stops until you add more funds
- **Flexible payment timing**: Add funds whenever you need them, not on a fixed schedule

**Example**: If you purchase our $40 prepaid plan, you'll pay $40 today and immediately receive 10GB of data, unlimited talk and text for the next 30 days. When your 30 days are up, your service will pause until you make another payment.

## Postpaid Service

With postpaid service, you pay for your usage **after** you've used it. Here's how it works:

- **Monthly billing**: You receive a bill at the end of your billing cycle for services used
- **Credit check required**: Typically requires a credit check during signup
- **Potential overage charges**: If you exceed your plan limits, you'll be charged additional fees
- **Auto-pay options**: Can set up automatic payments from your bank account or credit card
- **Family/multi-line options**: Often offers better rates for multiple lines on one account

**Example**: With our $50 postpaid plan, you'll receive unlimited talk and text plus 15GB of data. If you use 17GB during your billing cycle, you'll see your regular $50 charge plus an overage charge of $15 (2GB × $7.50/GB) on your next bill.

## Key Differences in Billing

| Feature | Prepaid | Postpaid |
|---------|---------|----------|
| When you pay | Before service | After service |
| Contract requirement | No contract | Often 1-2 year contracts |
| Taxes and fees | Usually included in advertised price | Often added separately to bill |
| Device payment options | Usually pay full price upfront | Can finance devices over 24-36 months |
| International roaming | May require separate add-ons | Often included in premium plans |

## Managing Your Account

**For prepaid service**: Check your balance and add funds through:
- Our mobile app (available for iOS and Android)
- Your online account at our website
- By dialing *729 from your device
- At any authorized retail location

**For postpaid service**: View and pay your bill through:
- Our mobile app's ""Billing"" section
- Your online account dashboard
- Customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX
- Mail-in payment with your bill statement

## Common Questions

**Can I switch between prepaid and postpaid?**
Yes! You can typically switch between billing types, though you may need to complete a credit check when moving to postpaid. Contact customer service to explore your options.

**Will my phone work with both billing types?**
Most unlocked phones work with both prepaid and postpaid plans. However, some prepaid-specific phones may be locked to prepaid service only.

**Which is better for international travelers?**
Postpaid plans often include better international features, but prepaid can be ideal for controlling costs while traveling. Consider adding an international package to either type before your trip.","subscription,prepaid,differences,faq,postpaid,prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,network,billing",2024-05-30,"ID: KB-1136

KB-1139,FAQ,Billing,Disputing charges,How Can I Dispute a Charge on My Bill?,"# How Can I Dispute a Charge on My Bill?

## Understanding Your Bill and Identifying Disputed Charges

If you notice unexpected or incorrect charges on your monthly bill, you have the right to dispute them. Our billing team is committed to resolving your concerns quickly and fairly.

### Common Disputable Charges

* **Overage fees**: For example, if you're charged $15 for exceeding your data limit but believe you stayed within your 10GB plan
* **Equipment charges**: Such as being billed $35/month for a device you've already paid off
* **Service fees**: Like a $5 paper billing fee when you've enrolled in paperless billing
* **Plan discrepancies**: Being charged $89.99 instead of the $69.99 promotional rate you signed up for
* **Third-party charges**: Subscriptions or premium services (sometimes called ""cramming"") that you didn't authorize

## How to Dispute a Charge

1. **Gather information**: Have your account number, the bill in question, and any supporting documentation ready (confirmation emails, previous bills, etc.)

2. **Contact us promptly**: Disputes should be submitted within 30 days of receiving your bill for fastest resolution

3. **Choose your preferred method**:
   * **Mobile app**: Tap ""Billing"" → ""View Bill"" → Select the charge → ""Dispute This Charge""
   * **Online account**: Log in at myaccount.ourcompany.com → ""Billing History"" → Select bill → ""Dispute Charge""
   * **Phone**: Call customer support at 1-800-555-0123
   * **Store visit**: Bring your bill and ID to any retail location

4. **Provide details**: Clearly explain why you believe the charge is incorrect

## What Happens Next?

* You should still pay the undisputed portion of your bill by the due date
* Resolution typically takes 5-7 business days
* We'll notify you via your preferred contact method (text/email/phone) once resolved

## Example Dispute Resolution

If you're on our Family Share 20GB plan ($120/month) but were charged for 25GB usage ($15 overage fee), we would:
* Verify your actual data usage for the billing period
* If our systems show you used 18GB, we'd remove the $15 charge
* If our review confirms 25GB usage, we'd explain which devices used the data and when
* We might recommend upgrading to our 30GB plan ($135/month) to save on future overages

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will disputing a charge affect my service?**
A: No, your service will continue uninterrupted while we investigate.

**Q: What if I'm not satisfied with the resolution?**
A: You can escalate to a billing supervisor who will conduct a secondary review.

**Q: Is there a time limit for disputing charges?**

* Resolution typically takes 5-7 business days
* We'll notify you via your preferred contact method (text/email/phone) once resolved

## Example Dispute Resolution

If you're on our Family Share 20GB plan ($120/month) but were charged for 25GB usage ($15 overage fee), we would:
* Verify your actual data usage for the billing period
* If our systems show you used 18GB, we'd remove the $15 charge
* If our review confirms 25GB usage, we'd explain which devices used the data and when
* We might recommend upgrading to our 30GB plan ($135/month) to save on future overages

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will disputing a charge affect my service?**
A: No, your service will continue uninterrupted while we investigate.

**Q: What if I'm not satisfied with the resolution?**
A: You can escalate to a billing supervisor who will conduct a secondary review.

**Q: Is there a time limit for disputing charges?**
A: We recommend disputing within 30 days, but we'll investigate charges from the past 6 months.

**Q: Can I dispute recurring charges from previous bills?**
A: Yes, if we find an error has occurred over multiple billing cycles, we'll issue credit for up to 6 months of incorrect charges.

KB-1141,FAQ,Billing,Family plan billing,How Does Family Plan Billing Work?,"# How Does Family Plan Billing Work?

Family plans allow multiple lines to share data, talk, and text under one account. Understanding how your family plan billing works helps you manage costs and avoid surprises on your monthly statement.

## Basic Structure of Your Family Plan Bill

Your monthly bill consists of:

1. **Base plan charge** - This is the core cost of your selected family plan tier
2. **Per-line access fees** - A charge for each phone line on your account
3. **Add-ons and extras** - Any additional services you've selected
4. **Taxes and regulatory fees** - Government-required charges

## Example Breakdown

For example, on our popular Share More Family Plan:
- Base plan (includes 15GB shared data): $70/month
- Line access fees: $20/month per line
- Total for a family of four: $70 + ($20 × 4) = $150/month before taxes and add-ons

## Common Charges Explained

**Data overage fees**: If your family exceeds the shared data allowance, you'll see charges of $15 per additional GB. You can monitor your family's data usage through our mobile app (available for iOS and Android) or your online account.

**Line-specific add-ons**: Some features apply to individual lines rather than the whole account. For instance, if one family member adds international texting ($5/month) to their line, only that line incurs the charge.

**One-time charges**: These might include activation fees when adding a new line ($30) or device upgrade fees ($35).

## Prorated Charges

When you add or remove lines mid-billing cycle, you'll see prorated charges. For example, if you add a line halfway through your billing cycle, you'll be charged for only half the month's access fee.

## Managing Your Family Plan

You can designate which lines have permission to:
- Add paid services
- Purchase content
- Exceed data limits

Set these permissions in your account settings online or through our mobile app.

## Need More Help?

If you notice unexpected charges on your bill, you can:
- View detailed line-by-line usage in your online account
- Set up usage alerts through our mobile app
- Contact customer support with your account number and the specific charges in question

KB-1142,FAQ,Billing,Prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?,"# What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?

Prepaid and postpaid are two fundamentally different ways to pay for your mobile service, each with distinct advantages and billing processes.

## Prepaid Service

With prepaid service, you pay for your usage in advance. Here's how it works:

- **Pay first, use later**: You purchase a set amount of service (talk, text, data) before using it
- **No credit check required**: Since you pay upfront, there's no financial risk assessment
- **No monthly bill**: Instead of receiving a bill, you'll get low-balance notifications through our mobile app or via SMS
- **No overage charges**: When you run out of data or minutes, service stops unless you add more funds (no surprise charges)
- **Flexible payment timing**: Add funds whenever needed—weekly, monthly, or as your balance gets low

**Example**: If you purchase our $40 prepaid plan, you'll pay $40 upfront and receive 10GB of data, unlimited talk and text for 30 days. When your 30 days are up or your data runs out (whichever comes first), you'll need to refill your account to continue service.

## Postpaid Service

With postpaid service, you use your service first and pay for it at the end of your billing cycle:

- **Use first, pay later**: You receive a monthly bill for services already used
- **Credit check required**: We'll check your credit history during sign-up
- **Monthly bill**: You'll receive a detailed bill showing base plan charges and any additional usage
- **Possible overage charges**: If you exceed your plan limits, you'll see additional charges on your bill
- **Fixed payment schedule**: Bills are generated on your cycle date each month

**Example**: With our $50 postpaid unlimited plan, you'll be billed $50 at the end of your billing cycle. If you added premium services (like international calling at $0.25/minute) or device payments ($27/month for a new smartphone), these would appear as separate line items on your bill.

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Feature | Prepaid | Postpaid |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Payment timing | Before usage | After usage |
| Credit check | No | Yes |
| Contract requirement | No | Often yes (12-24 months) |
| Overage charges | No (service stops) | Yes (additional fees) |
| Family/multi-line options | Limited | Extensive |
| Device payment plans | Limited | Widely available |

## Managing Your Account

Both prepaid and postpaid accounts can be managed through our mobile app (available for iOS and Android) or online account portal where you can:

- View usage details
- Make payments
- Change plans
- Add features

## Still have questions?

- **Want to switch between prepaid and postpaid?** You can change your billing type through our app or by contacting customer support.
- **Wondering which is better for your usage?** Prepaid typically works best for budget-conscious customers who want spending control, while postpaid offers more premium features and device financing options.
- **Need help understanding specific charges?** Our customer support team can provide a detailed breakdown of any charges on your account.","payment,prepaid,differences,faq,roaming,postpaid,prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,support,billing",2024-05-31,"ID: KB-1142

KB-1143,FAQ,Billing,Prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?,"# What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?

## The Basics

**Prepaid service** means you pay for your service before you use it. You purchase a set amount of talk, text, and data upfront, and once you've used it up, you'll need to ""refill"" or ""top up"" your account to continue service.

**Postpaid service** means you use your service first and then receive a bill at the end of your billing cycle (typically monthly). You're billed for the services you've already used, plus any applicable fees and taxes.

## Payment Timing

**Prepaid:** You pay before receiving service. For example, if you purchase a $40 prepaid plan on May 1st, you'll have service until May 31st (or until you use up your allotted talk, text, or data).

**Postpaid:** You pay after using the service. If your billing cycle runs from the 15th to the 14th of each month, you'll receive a bill on the 15th for services used during the previous 30 days.

## Plan Features

**Prepaid plans typically include:**
- Fixed amount of talk, text, and data
- No credit check required
- No contract required
- No overage charges (service stops when you reach your limit)
- Example: $45/month for unlimited talk, text, and 5GB of data

**Postpaid plans typically include:**
- Monthly allowances with potential overage charges
- Often offer family/multi-line discounts
- May require credit check and contract
- Access to device financing/installment plans
- Example: $70/month for unlimited talk, text, and data with the ability to add additional lines for $40 each

## Billing Calculations

**Prepaid Example:**
You purchase a $50 plan with 8GB of data on June 1st. By June 20th, you've used 7.5GB of data. You'll receive notifications as you approach your limit. Once you reach 8GB, data service will stop unless you purchase additional data (like $10 for an extra 1GB).

**Postpaid Example:**
Your plan costs $75/month for 10GB of shared data. During your billing cycle, you use 12GB. Your bill will show the $75 base charge plus an overage charge (typically $15 for the additional 2GB at $7.50/GB).

## Account Management

**Prepaid:**
- Manage your account through our mobile app or online portal
- Set up auto-refill to automatically renew your service
- Add funds anytime through the app, website, or by purchasing refill cards at retail locations
- Monitor your usage in real-time through the app (available for both iOS and Android)

**Postpaid:**
- View and pay bills through our mobile app or online account center
- Set up autopay to avoid late fees
- Detailed monthly statements showing all charges and usage
- Option to receive paper bills or go paperless

## Which is right for you?

**Consider prepaid if:**
- You want predictable monthly costs with no surprise charges
- You prefer not to undergo a credit check
- You want flexibility without a contract
- You have consistent usage patterns

**Consider postpaid if:**
- You want family plan options
- You need to finance a new device
- You prefer premium features and priority customer service
- Your usage varies month to month

KB-1145,Policy,Technical,Data throttling,Data Throttling Policy,"# Data Throttling Policy

## Overview
This policy document outlines our approach to data throttling, which is the temporary reduction of data speeds for certain customers under specific circumstances. This practice helps us maintain network quality for all customers while managing network capacity effectively.

## What Is Data Throttling
Data throttling is the intentional slowing of internet service speeds under certain conditions. When throttling is applied, customers may experience reduced speeds for activities such as streaming, downloading, and browsing until the throttling condition ends.

## When Data Throttling Applies

### Data Plan Thresholds
- Customers on unlimited plans may experience reduced speeds after exceeding [XX] GB of data usage within a billing cycle
- Throttling typically reduces speeds to [3-5] Mbps for standard plans and [8-10] Mbps for premium plans
- Speed restrictions reset automatically at the beginning of each billing cycle

### Network Management
- Temporary throttling may occur during periods of network congestion
- Prioritization systems ensure emergency services and critical communications remain unaffected
- Congestion-based throttling is applied on a cell-tower by cell-tower basis

## Customer Notification Protocols
- Automated SMS alerts will be sent when customers reach 75%, 90%, and 100% of their high-speed data threshold
- In-app notifications will appear when opening our mobile application (available on iOS and Android)
- Account management portal will display current data usage and throttling status
- Email notifications are sent when throttling is applied (if customer has opted in)

## Service Standards
- Throttled speeds will never fall below [2] Mbps for standard plans and [5] Mbps for premium plans
- Video streaming quality may be limited to standard definition (480p) during throttling periods
- Essential services including voice calls, text messages, and emergency services are never throttled

## Maintenance Windows
- Scheduled network maintenance that may affect data speeds will be conducted between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM local time
- Customers will receive notification of planned maintenance at least 48 hours in advance via SMS and app notification
- Emergency maintenance may occur without prior notice but will be communicated as soon as possible

## Customer Options and Remediation

### Self-Service Options
- Monitor data usage through our mobile app or online account portal
- Purchase additional high-speed data through the app, website, or by texting ""DATA"" to [shortcode]
- Upgrade to a plan with higher data thresholds or premium prioritization

### Customer Support
- Technical support is available 24/7 to address throttling concerns
- Customers experiencing speeds below our guaranteed minimums may request service credits
- Disputes regarding throttling implementation can be submitted for review within 30 days

## Customer Responsibilities
- Monitoring personal data usage through provided tools
- Understanding plan limitations and thresholds
- Reporting persistent speed issues that appear to violate this policy
- Maintaining current contact information to receive notifications

## Company Obligations
- Providing transparent information about throttling practices
- Maintaining accurate data usage tracking systems
- Ensuring throttling is applied fairly and in accordance with this policy
- Providing tools to monitor and manage data usage
- Maintaining reasonable network management practices

KB-1147,FAQ,Billing,Payment due dates,When is my payment due?,"# When is my payment due?

Your payment is due on the date shown on your monthly bill, typically 14-21 days after your billing cycle closes. This due date remains consistent each month unless you change your billing cycle.

## Understanding your due date

Your bill is generated on your ""bill cycle date"" - the same day each month. For example, if your bill cycle is the 5th, we'll prepare your bill on May 5th for the upcoming month of service. Your payment would then be due approximately two weeks later (around May 19th).

You can find your specific due date:
- At the top of your paper bill
- On the summary page of your online bill
- In the ""Billing"" section of our mobile app (available for iOS and Android)
- By texting ""DUE DATE"" to 12345 from your registered mobile number

## What happens if I miss my due date?

If payment isn't received by the due date:
- A late fee of $5 or 1.5% of the unpaid balance (whichever is greater) may be applied
- After 3 days, you might receive payment reminders via text or email
- After 7 days, service restrictions may begin
- After 30 days, service suspension may occur

## Payment options and timing

Different payment methods have different processing times:
- Online payments through our website/app: Same-day processing if made before 8 PM ET
- Automatic payments: Processed on the due date (or your selected date)
- Phone payments: Same-day processing
- In-store payments: Same-day processing
- Mail payments: Allow 5-7 business days for delivery and processing

## Can I change my due date?

Yes! You can request a one-time due date change through:
- Your online account (under ""Billing Preferences"")
- Our mobile app
- Customer service (800-555-1234)

You may select any date between the 1st and 28th of the month. Please note that changing your due date may result in a one-time shorter or longer billing cycle to accommodate the change.

## Need more help?

If you're experiencing difficulty making your payment by the due date, please contact us before your bill is due. We offer several options that might help, including payment arrangements and financial hardship programs.","payment,subscription,payment due dates,faq,wireless,phone,billing,dates",2024-10-15,"ID: KB-1147

KB-1151,Guide,Technical,Network coverage,Understanding and Optimizing Network Coverage,"# Understanding and Optimizing Network Coverage

## Introduction
Network coverage refers to the geographical area where your mobile device can connect to your service provider's cellular network. This guide will help you understand, check, and optimize your network coverage to ensure the best possible connection.

## Prerequisites Before Troubleshooting
- Ensure your account is active and in good standing
- Confirm your device is not in Airplane Mode
- Verify your SIM card is properly inserted
- Make sure your device's software is up to date

## Checking Your Network Coverage

### Method 1: Using Your Service Provider's Coverage Map

1. **Access the coverage map**
   - Visit your provider's website or open their mobile app
   - Navigate to the ""Coverage"" or ""Network"" section
   - iOS users: Look for the coverage tool in your provider's app menu
   - Android users: Coverage information is typically in the main menu or account section
   
   *Expected result: You'll see a map showing coverage strength in different areas*

2. **Check your specific location**
   - Enter your address or use location services to pinpoint your position
   - Review the color-coded coverage indicators (typically green for strong, yellow for moderate, red for weak)
   
   *Success indicator: You can confirm whether your location should have adequate coverage*

### Method 2: Checking Signal Strength on Your Device

1. **View signal bars**
   - Look at the signal indicator in the status bar of your device
   - 3-5 bars indicates good coverage; 1-2 bars indicates weak coverage
   
   *Expected behavior: Signal bars provide a quick visual reference of current network strength*

2. **Check detailed signal information**
   - **For Android:**
     - Go to Settings > About Phone > Status > SIM Status
     - Look for ""Signal strength"" or ""Signal level"" (measured in dBm)
     - -50 to -85 dBm indicates excellent signal
     - -86 to -100 dBm indicates good signal
     - Below -100 dBm indicates poor signal
   
   - **For iOS:**
     - Dial *3001#12345#* and press Call to enter Field Test Mode
     - Look for ""Signal Strength"" (measured in dBm)
     - The same dBm ranges apply as for Android
   
   *Success indicator: You can see the exact signal strength value to better understand your coverage*

## Resolving Common Coverage Issues

### Issue 1: Weak Signal Indoors

1. **Identify problem areas in your home/office**
   - Walk around with your phone displaying signal strength
   - Note where signal is weakest and strongest
   
   *Expected behavior: Signal strength will vary in different locations*

2. **Move closer to windows or exterior walls**
   - Cellular signals penetrate buildings better through openings
   - Avoid basements and interior rooms when possible
   
   *Success indicator: Signal bars increase when positioned optimally*

3. **Consider a signal booster**
   - Contact your provider about network extenders or signal boosters
   - These devices amplify existing signals to improve indoor coverage
   
   *Expected result: Consistent coverage throughout your space after installation*

### Issue 2: Intermittent Coverage

1. **Toggle Airplane Mode**
   - Turn on Airplane Mode for 30 seconds
   - Turn off Airplane Mode to force your device to reconnect to the network
   
   *Expected behavior: Your device will search for the strongest available signal*

2. **Restart your device**
   - Power off your device completely
   - Wait 30 seconds, then power it back on
   
   *Success indicator: Your device connects to a stronger signal after restarting*

3. **Check network mode settings**
   - **For Android:**
     - Go to Settings > Connections > Mobile Networks > Network Mode
     - Try different options (5G/LTE/3G/2G) to see which provides better coverage
   
   - **For iOS:**
     - Go to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Voice & Data
     - Select different options to find the best connection
   
   *Expected result: Changing network mode may connect you to a more stable network type*

### Issue 3: No Service in Expected Coverage Areas

1. **Update your carrier settings**
   - **For iOS:**
     - Go to Settings > General > About

KB-1153,FAQ,Billing,Refund policy,What is the refund policy for charges on my bill?,"# What is the refund policy for charges on my bill?

When you see unexpected charges on your bill or need to request a refund, we're here to help. Our refund policy is designed to be fair and transparent, with different guidelines depending on the type of charge.

## General Refund Guidelines

* **Time Limit**: Refund requests must typically be submitted within 60 days of the charge appearing on your bill
* **Processing Time**: Most approved refunds appear as credits on your next bill, though some may take 1-2 billing cycles
* **Method of Refund**: Refunds are generally issued as account credits, but can be processed to your original payment method upon request

## Service Plan Charges

If you've been charged for a service plan that wasn't what you requested or expected:

* **Plan Change Refunds**: If you downgrade your plan (e.g., from our Premium Unlimited at $85/month to Basic Unlimited at $65/month) mid-billing cycle, we'll prorate the difference and credit your account. For example, if you downgrade 15 days into a 30-day billing cycle, you'd receive approximately $10 credit.

* **New Plan Satisfaction Guarantee**: New plans have a 14-day satisfaction guarantee. If you switch back to your previous plan within this period, we'll refund the difference without prorating.

## One-Time Purchases and Features

* **Add-On Features**: One-time add-ons like international day passes ($10/day) or data boosters ($15/2GB) are non-refundable once used, even partially.

* **Device Insurance Claims**: The $29-$199 deductible (depending on device tier) for insurance claims is non-refundable once your replacement device has been shipped.

## Billing Errors and Disputes

If you believe there's an error on your bill:

* **Documentation**: Please have your bill ready when contacting us. Screenshots from your online account or mobile app (available on both iOS and Android) showing the disputed charge are helpful.

* **Overcharges**: If we've made a billing error, we'll refund the full amount plus any associated taxes and fees.

## How to Request a Refund

1. **Online**: Log into your account at our website or through our mobile app
2. **Phone**: Call customer support at the number on your bill
3. **In-Store**: Visit any of our retail locations with a copy of your bill

## Frequently Asked Follow-Up Questions

**Q: Can I get a refund for service outages?**
A: For significant network outages lasting more than 24 hours, you may be eligible for bill credits. These are calculated at a daily rate based on your monthly service charge.

**Q: What if I cancel my service entirely?**
A: Upon cancellation, we'll calculate your final bill based on the days of service used. Any device payment plans will become due in full. Prepaid accounts with remaining balances over $10 will be refunded via check to your address on file.

**Q: How are taxes and fees handled in refunds?**
A: When a service charge is refunded, associated taxes and fees are also refunded. For partial refunds, taxes and fees are prorated accordingly.

KB-1157,FAQ,Billing,Third-party charges,What are third-party charges on my bill?,"# What are third-party charges on my bill?

Third-party charges are fees that appear on your monthly bill for services provided by companies other than our telecom network. These charges (sometimes called ""cramming"") can include premium content subscriptions, digital services, or app purchases that you've authorized—either knowingly or unknowingly.

## Common examples of third-party charges:

* Premium text message subscriptions ($4.99-$9.99/month)
* Mobile game subscriptions ($1.99-$19.99/month)
* Digital content services like horoscopes, trivia, or weather alerts ($2.99-$6.99/month)
* App store purchases billed through your carrier ($0.99-$99.99 per transaction)
* Donation campaigns where you text to donate ($5-$25 per donation)

## How to identify third-party charges

On your bill, look for sections labeled:
* ""Third-Party Charges""
* ""Premium Services""
* ""Purchases & Downloads""
* ""Other Service Provider Charges""

Each charge should include the service name and a contact number for the third-party provider.

## What to do if you don't recognize a charge

1. **Check with family members** on your account who might have subscribed to services
2. **Contact the third-party provider** directly using the number listed on your bill
3. **Log into your online account** or mobile app to view detailed billing information
   * iOS users: Check ""Subscriptions"" in your Apple ID settings
   * Android users: Review ""Subscriptions"" in Google Play Store

4. **Contact our customer service** if you need help identifying or disputing charges

## How to prevent unwanted third-party charges

* Enable purchase blocks through your online account or our mobile app
* Set up spending notifications to alert you of unusual activity
* Review app permissions carefully before downloading
* Consider enabling parental controls on lines used by children

We're committed to billing transparency. If you believe you've been charged incorrectly, please contact us within 60 days of receiving your bill, and we'll help investigate the charge.","third-party charges,faq,charges,third-party,coverage,phone,billing,customer",2024-11-10,"ID: KB-1157

- **Payment due date**: The date by which payment must be received (e.g., the 26th of each month)
- **Service period**: The timeframe covered by this bill (e.g., June 1-30)

For example, if your billing date is June 5th, your payment would be due by June 26th for services covering the previous month.

## Payment options

You can pay your bill through multiple channels:
- **Mobile app**: Make instant payments through our app (available on iOS and Android)
- **Online account**: Log in at www.ourcompany.com/myaccount

2. After 7 days past due, you'll receive a payment reminder notification
3. After 30 days past due, service interruption may occur

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I change my billing date?**
Yes, you can request a billing date change through your online account or by contacting customer service. This may result in a one-time prorated bill to align with your new cycle.

**Will I be notified before my payment is due?**
Yes! We send payment reminders via your preferred communication method (email, text, or app notification) 5 days before your due date if you've enabled notifications in your account settings.

When you experience a service outage or interruption that's our fault, you may be eligible for a credit on your bill. These credits compensate you for the time you couldn't use the service you're paying for.

## How Credits Are Calculated
Service interruption credits are typically calculated based on your daily rate and the duration of the outage:

- **Daily Rate Calculation**: We divide your monthly service charge by 30 days
- **Credit Amount**: Daily rate × number of days (or partial days) service was unavailable

For example, if you pay $60/month for internet service and experience a 2-day outage:
- Daily rate: $60 ÷ 30 = $2 per day
- Credit amount: $2 × 2 days = $4 credit

## Eligibility Requirements
To qualify for a service interruption credit:

1. The outage must be verified in our system or reported within 72 hours
2. The interruption must last longer than 4 consecutive hours (unless otherwise specified in your service agreement)
3. The issue must be within our network (not due to your equipment or third-party services)

## How to Request a Credit
You can request a service interruption credit through:

- **Mobile App**: Navigate to ""Billing"" → ""Report an Issue"" → ""Service Interruption""
- **Online Account**: Log in at our website, select ""Billing"" and then ""Request Credit""
- **Customer Service**: Call the number on your bill
- **Retail Store**: Visit any of our store locations

## When Credits Appear on Your Bill
Credits typically appear on your next bill after approval. You'll see a line item labeled ""Service Interruption Credit"" with the corresponding amount. If the credit is approved after your billing cycle closes, it will appear on the following month's bill.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to report an outage to get a credit?**
A: For widespread outages we track in our system, credits may be applied automatically. For isolated issues, you should report the problem to ensure you receive credit.

**Q: Are there limits to how much credit I can receive?**
A: Yes. Credits are typically capped at the monthly cost of the affected service. Premium services like TV packages may have different credit calculations based on your specific plan.

**Q: What if I have bundled services?**
A: If only one service in your bundle was affected (e.g., internet was down but phone worked), the credit applies only to the affected service portion of your bundle.

**Q: Will my autopay be adjusted for the credit?**
A: Yes, any approved credits will be reflected in your autopay amount for both iOS and Android app users as well as online account management customers.

If you have additional questions about service interruption credits on your bill, please contact our customer support team.","interruption,service interruption credits,service,credits,faq,network,phone,billing",2024-11-06,"ID: KB-1163

KB-1165,FAQ,Billing,Prorated billing,What is prorated billing and why do I see partial charges on my bill?,"# What is prorated billing and why do I see partial charges on my bill?

## Understanding Prorated Billing

Prorated billing occurs when you're charged only for the portion of your billing cycle that you actually used a service. This commonly happens when you:

- Make changes to your plan mid-billing cycle
- Add or remove features/services
- Activate a new line
- Cancel a line or service

Rather than charging the full amount, we calculate a daily rate and multiply it by the number of days you used the service in that billing cycle.

## How Prorated Charges Are Calculated

Here's how we calculate prorated charges:

1. We divide your monthly plan or feature cost by the number of days in your billing cycle
2. We multiply this daily rate by the number of days the service was active

**Example:**
- Your unlimited data plan costs $60 per month
- You upgrade from a $40 plan on the 15th day of a 30-day billing cycle
- You'll be charged $40 ÷ 30 × 15 = $20 for the first plan (first 15 days)
- You'll be charged $60 ÷ 30 × 15 = $30 for the new plan (remaining 15 days)
- Your total plan charges for this cycle would be $50 instead of $60

## Common Scenarios Where You'll See Prorated Charges

### Plan Changes
When you upgrade or downgrade your plan mid-cycle, you'll see two partial charges: one for your old plan and one for your new plan.

### Adding Lines
If you add a new line on day 10 of a 30-day billing cycle, you'll be charged for 20 days of service instead of the full month.

### Adding Features
Adding premium features like international calling or additional data mid-cycle will result in partial charges for that feature.

## How to Identify Prorated Charges on Your Bill

Prorated charges typically appear on your bill with:
- The service name
- A date range showing when the service was active
- The partial amount charged

You can view these details in your online account or through our mobile app (available for iOS and Android).

## Frequently Asked Follow-Up Questions

**Will my bill return to normal next month?**
Yes, assuming no further changes are made, your next bill will show the full monthly rate for your current plan and features.

**Why is my first bill higher than expected?**
Your first bill often includes prorated charges for your current billing cycle plus charges for your next full month of service in advance.

**Can I schedule changes to avoid prorated billing?**
Yes! Making changes on your billing cycle date will minimize prorated charges. You can view your billing cycle dates in your online account or mobile app.

Need more help understanding your specific charges? Contact our billing support team or use the ""Analyze My Bill"" feature in our mobile app.","subscription,troubleshooting,faq,prorated,data,prorated billing,billing",2025-04-22,"ID: KB-1165

KB-1168,FAQ,Technical,Data throttling,What is Data Throttling and How Can I Fix Slow Data Speeds?,"# What is Data Throttling and How Can I Fix Slow Data Speeds?

## Understanding Data Throttling

Data throttling occurs when your mobile carrier temporarily reduces your data speeds after you've reached a certain threshold in your data plan. This is different from a data cap, which cuts off data access completely.

### How to Identify if You're Being Throttled

1. **Check your data usage:**
   * **iOS:** Go to Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Usage
   * **Android:** Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Data Usage (may vary by device manufacturer)

2. **Look for these indicators:**
   * Sudden decrease in speeds after using a certain amount of data
   * Normal speeds during off-peak hours but slow speeds during busy times
   * Video streaming automatically switching to lower quality
   * Common error message: ""You've reached your high-speed data limit for this billing cycle""

## Troubleshooting Steps for Slow Data Speeds

### Step 1: Confirm if it's actually throttling
1. Check your data usage in your carrier's mobile app or online account
2. Look for notifications about reaching data limits
3. Run a speed test (using apps like Speedtest by Ookla) at different times of day

### Step 2: Basic troubleshooting
1. Restart your device
   * **iOS:** Press and hold power button, slide to power off, then restart
   * **Android:** Press and hold power button, select restart

2. Toggle Airplane mode on and off
   * **iOS:** Swipe up (or down from top-right on newer models) for Control Center, tap Airplane icon
   * **Android:** Swipe down for Quick Settings, tap Airplane Mode

3. Reset network settings
   * **iOS:** Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings
   * **Android:** Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth

### Step 3: Manage your data usage
1. Enable Data Saver/Low Data Mode
   * **iOS:** Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Low Data Mode
   * **Android:** Settings > Network & Internet > Data Saver

2. Disable background app refresh
   * **iOS:** Settings > General > Background App Refresh
   * **Android:** Settings > Apps > (select app) > Data usage > Background data

## When to Contact Customer Support

Contact our support team if:

* Your speeds are significantly slower than expected even though you haven't reached your data limit
* You're experiencing throttling despite having an unlimited plan that shouldn't throttle at your current usage
* You received no notification about reaching data limits but are experiencing slow speeds
* Throttling continues after the start of a new billing cycle
* The troubleshooting steps above don't resolve the issue

**Contact Information:**
* Call: [Customer Support Number]
* Chat: Through our mobile app or website
* Visit: Your nearest retail store

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How can I avoid data throttling in the future?**
A: Consider upgrading your data plan, connecting to Wi-Fi when available, and monitoring your data usage regularly through our mobile app.

**Q: Will using Wi-Fi count toward my mobile data limit?**
A: No, data used while connected to Wi-Fi doesn't count toward your mobile data allowance.

**Q: How long does throttling last?**

KB-1171,FAQ,Account,Account pins and passwords,How Do I Manage My Account PIN and Password?,"# How Do I Manage My Account PIN and Password?

## Understanding Your Account Security Credentials

Your account PIN and password are critical security measures that protect your personal information and prevent unauthorized changes to your account. While they serve similar purposes, they function differently:

**Account PIN**: A 4-6 digit number used primarily for phone-based verification when contacting customer service. This PIN helps our representatives verify your identity before discussing account details or making changes.

**Account Password**: A more complex credential (8-16 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters) used primarily for online account access through our website and mobile app.

## Setting Up or Changing Your PIN

1. **Via Phone**: Call our customer service at 1-800-XXX-XXXX and follow the automated prompts for ""account security"" or speak with a representative. You'll need to verify your identity using your current PIN or alternative verification methods.

2. **Via Mobile App**: 
   * Open the [Carrier] app on your iOS or Android device
   * Navigate to Account → Security Settings → Manage PIN
   * Follow the on-screen instructions to create or update your PIN

3. **Via Website**:
   * Log in to your account at www.[carrier].com
   * Go to Account Settings → Security → Update PIN
   * Follow the prompts to complete the change

PIN changes take effect immediately. For security reasons, PINs cannot be recovered—only reset.

## Managing Your Account Password

1. **Creating a Strong Password**:
   * Use 8-16 characters
   * Include uppercase and lowercase letters
   * Add numbers and special characters
   * Avoid easily guessed information (birthdays, names)

2. **Changing Your Password**:
   * Via Website: Account Settings → Security → Change Password
   * Via Mobile App: Account → Security Settings → Password Management

3. **Password Reset**:
   * Click ""Forgot Password"" on the login screen
   * Verify your identity via text message code, email link, or security questions
   * Create and confirm your new password

Password changes take effect immediately across all platforms.

## Important Considerations

* **Verification Requirements**: Major account changes require both PIN and additional verification (email code, government ID, or last 4 digits of SSN).

* **Billing Impact**: PIN/password changes don't affect billing, but a forgotten PIN might delay account changes that could impact your bill.

* **Service Impact**: Three failed PIN attempts may temporarily restrict account access for 30 minutes as a security measure.

* **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enable this additional security feature in your account settings for enhanced protection.

* **Authorized Users**: Only the primary account holder can change the account PIN. Authorized users may have their own login credentials but cannot modify the main account PIN.

If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, contact customer service immediately at 1-800-XXX-XXXX to secure your account.","payment,account,account pins and passwords,faq,pins,passwords,data,customer",2024-08-05,"ID: KB-1171

KB-1174,Policy,Billing,Prorated billing,Prorated Billing Policy,"# Prorated Billing Policy

## Overview
This policy outlines our approach to prorated billing, which applies when service changes occur mid-billing cycle. Prorated billing ensures customers only pay for the actual days of service received during partial billing periods.

## Definitions
**Prorated Billing:** The calculation of charges based on the actual number of days a service is active within a billing cycle.

**Billing Cycle:** The recurring period (typically monthly) for which service charges are applied to your account.

**Service Activation Date:** The date on which your service becomes active in our system.

**Service Change:** Any modification to your plan, features, or service status.

## Prorated Charges Calculation
Prorated charges are calculated using the following formula:
* (Monthly service charge ÷ Number of days in billing cycle) × Number of days service was active

## When Prorated Billing Applies

### New Service Activations
When you activate a new service mid-billing cycle, you will be charged only for the days remaining in that cycle. Your first bill will include:
* Prorated charges from activation date to end of billing cycle
* Full charges for the upcoming billing cycle

### Service Cancellations
When you cancel service mid-billing cycle:
* Your final bill will include charges only for days of active service
* Any applicable early termination fees will be clearly itemized
* Refunds for unused service will be processed within 30 days

### Plan Changes
When you upgrade or downgrade your plan mid-billing cycle:
* You'll be charged the prorated amount for your old plan up to the change date
* You'll be charged the prorated amount for your new plan from the change date to the end of the billing cycle

## Customer Rights and Obligations

### Customer Rights
* Receive a detailed breakdown of all prorated charges on your bill
* Request an explanation of prorated calculations within 60 days of billing date
* Dispute any billing errors within 60 days of the billing date

### Customer Obligations
* Review your bill for accuracy each month
* Notify us of any billing discrepancies within 60 days
* Understand that some one-time fees and charges may not be prorated

## Billing Statement Information
Your bill will clearly display:
* Regular monthly charges
* Prorated charges (if applicable)
* The specific date range for which prorated charges apply
* The calculation method used for prorating

## How to View Prorated Charges
* **Mobile App:** View detailed billing information in the ""Billing"" section
* **Online Account:** Log in to your account portal to access complete billing details
* **Customer Support:** Contact our billing department for explanation of prorated charges

## Policy Exceptions
Certain services and charges are not subject to proration, including but not limited to:
* One-time activation fees
* Equipment purchases
* Promotional credits
* Certain premium features as specified in service agreements

For questions regarding this policy, please contact our Customer Support team through our mobile app, online account portal, or by calling the number on your billing statement.","troubleshooting,text,policy,prorated,prorated billing,billing,customer",2025-03-10,"ID: KB-1174

KB-1183,FAQ,Billing,Prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?,"# What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?

## Overview
Prepaid and postpaid are two fundamentally different ways to pay for your mobile service. With prepaid, you pay in advance for your service, while with postpaid, you pay after you've used the service. Each option has distinct advantages and impacts how you manage your account, access features, and handle payments.

## Prepaid Service

### How prepaid billing works:
* You purchase credit or a plan before using the service
* Once your balance is depleted or your plan expires, service stops unless you recharge
* No monthly bill or contract required
* No credit check needed to sign up

### Typical prepaid charges:
* Plan costs: $15-$65 depending on data allowance (e.g., our $30 plan includes 5GB data)
* Pay-as-you-go rates: Calls at $0.10/minute, texts at $0.05 each, data at $0.10/MB
* Add-on packages: Additional data ($5 for 1GB), international calling bundles ($10 for 120 minutes)

### Managing your prepaid account:
* Check your balance anytime in our mobile app (iOS and Android)
* Set up auto-recharge to avoid service interruptions
* Unused data may expire at the end of your plan period (depending on plan)

## Postpaid Service

### How postpaid billing works:
* You use services first, then receive a monthly bill
* Service continues even if you exceed your plan limits (resulting in overage charges)
* Typically requires a credit check and may require a contract
* Monthly bill varies based on usage and additional services

### Typical postpaid charges:
* Base plan fee: Monthly recurring charge (e.g., $40 for our Basic plan with 10GB data)
* Overage charges: Data ($10 per additional GB), international calls (varies by country)
* Device payments: If you're financing a phone ($20-40/month depending on device)
* One-time fees: Activation ($30), late payment ($15), etc.

### Understanding your postpaid bill:
* Bills are generated on your billing cycle date each month
* Charges are itemized by service type (calls, texts, data, subscriptions)
* View and pay bills through our online account portal or mobile app
* Set up autopay to avoid late fees (and get a $5 monthly discount on most plans)

## Which is right for you?

**Consider prepaid if you:**
* Want predictable costs with no surprise charges
* Prefer to avoid credit checks or contracts
* Need flexibility to change or pause service
* Have variable usage patterns month to month

**Consider postpaid if you:**
* Want premium features and priority network access
* Plan to finance a new device
* Need family or multi-line plans with shared data
* Travel frequently and need seamless international options

## Still have questions?

If you're unsure which type of plan best fits your needs, you can:
* Use our Plan Comparison Tool in the mobile app
* Chat with a representative through the ""Support"" section of your online account
* Visit any of our retail stores for personalized assistance
* Switch between prepaid and postpaid options (note that this may require paying any outstanding balance and possibly a new activation fee)","payment,troubleshooting,prepaid,differences,faq,postpaid,prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,billing",2025-02-05,"ID: KB-1183

KB-1187,FAQ,Billing,Service interruption credits,How Do Service Interruption Credits Work on My Bill?,"# How Do Service Interruption Credits Work on My Bill?

## Overview
When you experience a service outage or interruption that's our fault, you may be eligible for a credit on your bill. These credits compensate you for the time you couldn't use the service you're paying for.

## How Credits Are Calculated
Service interruption credits are typically calculated based on your monthly service charge and the duration of the outage:

* **Formula**: (Monthly service charge ÷ 30 days) × Number of days affected
* **Example**: If you pay $60/month for internet service and experience a 2-day outage, your credit would be approximately $4 ($60 ÷ 30 × 2 = $4)

For shorter outages, we calculate by the hour:
* **Hourly Formula**: (Monthly service charge ÷ 720 hours) × Number of hours affected
* **Example**: A 5-hour mobile service outage on a $45/month plan would result in a credit of approximately $0.31 ($45 ÷ 720 × 5 = $0.31)

## Eligibility Requirements
To qualify for a service interruption credit:
1. The outage must be confirmed in our system or reported within 72 hours
2. The interruption must be due to our network or equipment failure
3. The outage must typically exceed 4 consecutive hours (though this may vary by service type)

## How to Request a Credit
You can request a service interruption credit through:
* Our mobile app (tap Account → Support → Report an Issue)
* Your online account dashboard (visit the ""Billing"" section)
* Customer service (call the number on your bill)

Be prepared to provide:
* The date and approximate duration of the outage
* How the service was affected
* Your account information

## When Credits Appear on Your Bill
Approved credits typically appear on your next bill statement labeled as ""Service Interruption Credit"" or ""Outage Credit."" If the billing cycle has already closed, the credit will appear on the following month's statement.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to pay my full bill if I'm waiting for a credit?**
Yes. Pay your bill as usual to avoid late fees. The credit will be applied to your next bill.

**Q: Are there outages that don't qualify for credits?**
Yes. Scheduled maintenance (with advance notice), issues with your own equipment, or force majeure events (natural disasters) typically don't qualify.

**Q: Is there a minimum outage duration to receive credit?**
Most service plans require at least 4 consecutive hours of outage before credits are issued, but this varies by service type and plan tier.

**Q: How far back can I claim a credit?**
Most credits must be requested within 60 days of the outage.

KB-1189,FAQ,Billing,Credit application,What is a credit application and how does it affect my account?,"# What is a credit application and how does it affect my account?

## Understanding Credit Applications

A credit application is a process we use to evaluate your financial history before establishing service or when requesting certain account changes. This helps us determine eligibility for postpaid services, device financing options, and may influence your deposit requirements.

## How the credit application process works:

1. **When you apply**: We'll ask for personal information including your name, address, Social Security Number, and date of birth.

2. **Credit check**: We partner with major credit bureaus to review your credit history. This appears as a ""soft inquiry"" on your credit report and doesn't impact your credit score.

3. **Decision process**: Our system evaluates your credit information against our approval criteria, typically providing an immediate decision.

## How credit applications affect your account:

* **Device financing eligibility**: Your credit determines if you qualify for device payment plans and how much you can finance.
* **Deposit requirements**: Customers with limited credit history may need to pay a security deposit (typically $50-$500 depending on credit standing).
* **Line limits**: Credit may determine how many lines you can have on your account.
* **Plan eligibility**: Some premium plans may require meeting certain credit thresholds.

## Example scenarios:

**Excellent credit**: May qualify for up to 10 lines with no deposit, eligible for all device financing options up to $1,500 per line.

**Good credit**: May qualify for up to 5 lines with a $50-100 deposit, eligible for device financing up to $1,000 per line.

**Limited/No credit**: May qualify for 1-2 lines with a $250-500 deposit, limited device financing options or prepaid service recommendation.

## Frequently asked follow-up questions:

**Can I check my application status?** Yes! Log into your account through our mobile app (iOS/Android) or website and select ""Application Status"" under the Account section.

**What if my application is denied?** You can still choose our prepaid service options which don't require a credit check. After 12 months of good payment history, you may become eligible for postpaid services.

**Will applying again improve my chances?** Multiple applications in a short period won't change the outcome and may appear as multiple inquiries. We recommend waiting 60-90 days before reapplying.

**How can I reduce my deposit?** You can enroll in AutoPay, provide a letter of good standing from another carrier, or add a qualified co-signer to potentially lower deposit requirements.

KB-1190,FAQ,Billing,Prepaid vs. postpaid billing differences,What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?,"# What's the difference between prepaid and postpaid billing?

Prepaid and postpaid are two fundamentally different ways to pay for your mobile service, each with unique features, benefits, and billing processes.

## Prepaid Service

With prepaid service, you pay for your usage **before** you use it. Here's how it works:

- **Pay upfront**: You purchase a set amount of service (talk, text, and data) before using it
- **No credit check required**: Since you pay in advance, there's no financial risk assessment
- **No monthly bill**: Instead of receiving a bill, you'll get low balance notifications
- **No overage charges**: When you run out of data or minutes, service stops until you refill
- **Flexible payment timing**: Add funds whenever needed, not on a fixed schedule

**Example**: If you purchase a $40 prepaid plan with 10GB of data on May 1st, you immediately pay $40 and can use up to 10GB until your service period ends (typically 30 days later). If you use all 10GB before the period ends, you'll need to purchase additional data to continue using data services.

You can manage your prepaid account through our mobile app (available on iOS and Android) or by dialing *729 from your device to check your balance and add funds.

## Postpaid Service

With postpaid service, you pay for your usage **after** you've used it. Here's how it works:

- **Monthly billing cycle**: You receive a bill for the previous month's service and usage
- **Credit check required**: Since we provide service before payment, we assess creditworthiness
- **Consistent monthly bill date**: Your bill arrives on approximately the same date each month
- **Possible overage charges**: If you exceed your plan limits, additional charges appear on your bill
- **Automatic payments**: Can be set up for convenience

**Example**: With a $70/month unlimited talk and text plan with 15GB of high-speed data, you'll receive a bill after your billing cycle ends. If your billing cycle runs from the 15th to the 14th of each month, you'll receive a bill around the 15th that includes:
- Your $70 base plan charge
- Any additional services you've added (like international calling: $5)
- Regulatory fees and taxes (typically 8-12% of your bill)
- Any overage charges (e.g., $15 for exceeding your high-speed data limit)

Your total might be approximately $86 plus any overages ($70 + $5 + ~$11 in taxes/fees).

## Which is right for you?

**Consider prepaid if you:**
- Want predictable costs with no surprise charges
- Prefer flexibility without a contract
- Have variable monthly usage
- Don't want to undergo a credit check

**Consider postpaid if you:**
- Want premium device financing options
- Prefer not worrying about refilling your account
- Need family or multi-line discounts
- Travel internationally frequently (better roaming options)

You can switch between prepaid and postpaid service by contacting customer support or visiting your online account portal at myaccount.ourcompany.com.

KB-1197,Guide,Technical,Device blacklist removal,Device Blacklist Removal Guide,"# Device Blacklist Removal Guide

## Introduction

A blacklisted device has been reported lost, stolen, or has unpaid financial obligations, preventing it from connecting to carrier networks. This guide will help you understand if your device is blacklisted and how to properly remove it from blacklist databases.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting blacklist removal:
- Ensure you have proof of ownership (purchase receipt, IMEI documentation)
- Verify your device's IMEI number (dial *#06# on most phones)
- Check your device's current blacklist status
- Have your account credentials ready

## Checking Blacklist Status

1. **Check via IMEI:**
   - Dial *#06# on your device to display the IMEI number
   - Write down the complete 15-digit number
   - Visit your carrier's website or a verification service like IMEI.info
   - Enter your IMEI number in the provided field
   - Review the status report (Clean, Blacklisted, Payment Required)

   *Expected result: You'll see your device's current blacklist status*

2. **Check via Customer Support:**
   - Contact your carrier's customer support
   - Provide your IMEI number and account verification
   - Request blacklist status information
   
   *Expected result: Representative will confirm if your device is blacklisted and why*

## Blacklist Removal Process

### Scenario 1: Device Reported Lost/Stolen (by you)

1. Contact the carrier where you originally reported the device:
   - Call customer service or visit a store location
   - Provide your account information and device IMEI
   - Explain that you've recovered your device
   - Request removal from the blacklist

2. Verify identity:
   - Present government-issued ID
   - Confirm account ownership details
   - May require original purchase documentation

3. Wait for processing:
   - Removal typically takes 24-48 hours
   - Some carriers provide immediate removal

   *Success indicator: Carrier confirms removal request is processed*

### Scenario 2: Device Has Financial Obligations

1. Determine the outstanding balance:
   - Log into your carrier account online
   - Check the ""Device Payment"" or ""Installment Plan"" section
   - Note the remaining balance

2. Settle the payment:
   - Pay through your carrier's mobile app or website
   - Visit a store location for payment
   - Call billing support to arrange payment

3. Request blacklist removal:
   - After payment confirmation, specifically request blacklist removal
   - Get a confirmation number or email

   *Success indicator: Payment confirmation and blacklist removal request acknowledgment*

### Scenario 3: Purchased Used Device (blacklisted by previous owner)

1. Gather documentation:
   - Your purchase receipt/proof of purchase
   - Device IMEI number
   - Previous owner's information (if available)

2. Contact the carrier that implemented the blacklist:
   - Explain you purchased the device legitimately
   - Provide all documentation
   - Request blacklist status investigation

3. Follow carrier-specific process:
   - May require affidavits or formal statements
   - Could involve communication with previous owner
   - Might need to file a police report in fraud cases

   *Success indicator: Carrier opens investigation case with reference number*

## Verification After Removal

1. Check blacklist status again:
   - Wait 24-48 hours after removal request
   - Repeat the IMEI check process
   - Verify status shows ""Clean"" or ""Clear""

2. Test network connectivity:
   - Insert SIM card
   - Restart device
   - Attempt to make calls and use data

3. If still blacklisted:
   - Contact carrier again with your case reference
   - Request escalation to specialized department
   - Ask for specific timeframe for resolution

## Device-Specific Considerations

### iOS Devices
- iPhones may have both carrier blacklists and Apple Activation Lock
- Check Activation Lock status in Settings > [Your Name] > Find My
- For carrier blacklist, follow standard procedures above

### Android Devices
- Some manufacturers maintain separate blacklists (especially Samsung)

# Device Blacklist Removal Guide

## Introduction

A blacklisted device has been reported lost, stolen, or has unpaid financial obligations, preventing it from connecting to carrier networks. This guide will help you understand if your device is blacklisted and how to properly remove it from blacklist databases.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting blacklist removal:
- Ensure you have proof of ownership (purchase receipt, IMEI documentation)
- Verify your device's IMEI number (dial *#06# on most phones)
- Check your device's current blacklist status
- Have your account credentials ready

## Checking Blacklist Status

1. **Check via IMEI:**
   - Dial *#06# on your device to display the IMEI number
   - Write down the complete 15-digit number
   - Visit your carrier's website or a verification service like IMEI.info
   - Enter your IMEI number in the provided field
   - Review the status report (Clean, Blacklisted, Payment Required)

   *Expected result: You'll see your device's current blacklist status*

2. **Check via Customer Support:**
   - Contact your carrier's customer support
   - Provide your IMEI number and account verification
   - Request blacklist status information
   
   *Expected result: Representative will confirm if your device is blacklisted and why*

## Blacklist Removal Process

### Scenario 1: Device Reported Lost/Stolen (by you)

1. Contact the carrier where you originally reported the device:
   - Call customer service or visit a store location
   - Provide your account information and device IMEI
   - Explain that you've recovered your device
   - Request removal from the blacklist

2. Verify identity:
   - Present government-issued ID
   - Confirm account ownership details
   - May require original purchase documentation

3. Wait for processing:
   - Removal typically takes 24-48 hours
   - Some carriers provide immediate removal

   *Success indicator: Carrier confirms removal request is processed*

### Scenario 2: Device Has Financial Obligations

1. Determine the outstanding balance:
   - Log into your carrier account online
   - Check the ""Device Payment"" or ""Installment Plan"" section
   - Note the remaining balance

2. Settle the payment:
   - Pay through your carrier's mobile app or website
   - Visit a store location for payment
   - Call billing support to arrange payment

3. Request blacklist removal:
   - After payment confirmation, specifically request blacklist removal
   - Get a confirmation number or email

   *Success indicator: Payment confirmation and blacklist removal request acknowledgment*

### Scenario 3: Purchased Used Device (blacklisted by previous owner)

1. Gather documentation:
   - Your purchase receipt/proof of purchase
   - Device IMEI number
   - Previous owner's information (if available)

2. Contact the carrier that implemented the blacklist:
   - Explain you purchased the device legitimately
   - Provide all documentation
   - Request blacklist status investigation

3. Follow carrier-specific process:
   - May require affidavits or formal statements
   - Could involve communication with previous owner
   - Might need to file a police report in fraud cases

   *Success indicator: Carrier opens investigation case with reference number*

## Verification After Removal

1. Check blacklist status again:
   - Wait 24-48 hours after removal request
   - Repeat the IMEI check process
   - Verify status shows ""Clean"" or ""Clear""

2. Test network connectivity:
   - Insert SIM card
   - Restart device
   - Attempt to make calls and use data

3. If still blacklisted:
   - Contact carrier again with your case reference
   - Request escalation to specialized department
   - Ask for specific timeframe for resolution

## Device-Specific Considerations

### iOS Devices
- iPhones may have both carrier blacklists and Apple Activation Lock
- Check Activation Lock status in Settings > [Your Name] > Find My
- For carrier blacklist, follow standard procedures above

### Android Devices
- Some manufacturers maintain separate blacklists (especially Samsung)
- Check with both carrier and manufacturer
- For Samsung devices, contact Samsung support in addition to carrier

KB-1208,FAQ,Billing,Unexpected charges explanation,Why am I seeing unexpected charges on my bill?,"# Why am I seeing unexpected charges on my bill?

It can be concerning to see charges you weren't expecting on your monthly bill. Here's a comprehensive explanation of common unexpected charges and what they might mean:

## Common Unexpected Charges

### Prorated Charges
When you make changes to your service mid-billing cycle (like upgrading your plan or adding a line), you'll see prorated charges. These are partial charges calculated based on the number of days you used each service.

**Example:** If you upgrade from a $60 plan to an $80 plan on the 15th day of a 30-day billing cycle, you might see:
- A credit of $30 (for 15 days remaining on your old plan)
- A charge of $40 (for 15 days on your new plan)

### One-time Fees
These are non-recurring charges that appear only on a single bill:
- Activation fees ($20-45 per new line)
- Device upgrade fees ($25-40)
- Late payment fees (typically $5-10)
- SIM card replacement fees ($10-25)

### Data Overage Charges
If you exceed your plan's data allowance, you may incur overage fees.

**Example:** If your plan includes 10GB of data and you use 12GB, you might be charged $15 for each additional GB ($30 total overage).

### International Usage
Using your phone outside your home country or calling/texting international numbers can result in significant charges:
- International roaming: $2-10 per day or $2-3 per MB of data
- International calls: $0.20-$3 per minute depending on the country
- International texts: $0.25-$0.50 per message

### Third-Party Charges
Sometimes called ""premium services"" or ""direct carrier billing,"" these are charges for subscriptions or services billed through your carrier:
- App store purchases
- Premium text message subscriptions
- Digital content subscriptions

### Regulatory Fees and Taxes
These government-mandated fees may fluctuate monthly:
- Universal Service Fund
- 911 service fees
- State and local telecommunications taxes

## How to Address Unexpected Charges

1. **Review your bill details**: Log into your online account or mobile app (available for both iOS and Android) to see itemized charges.

2. **Check for service changes**: Did you recently modify your plan, add features, or travel internationally?

3. **Monitor data usage**: Use our mobile app to track your data consumption in real-time and set usage alerts.

4. **Contact customer support**: If you still don't understand a charge, our support team can provide a detailed explanation.

## Frequently Asked Follow-up Questions

**Q: Can I dispute a charge I don't recognize?**
A: Yes. Contact customer support within 60 days of receiving your bill to dispute any charges you believe are incorrect.

**Q: How can I prevent overage charges in the future?**
A: Consider switching to an unlimited plan or setting up usage alerts through your online account or our mobile app.

**Q: Can I block third-party charges on my account?**
A: Yes, you can add a free ""purchase block"" to your account that prevents third-party billing.

## Setting Up or Changing Your PIN

You can set up or change your account PIN through several methods:

1. **Mobile App**: 
   - Navigate to Account → Security Settings → Manage PIN
   - Verification requires your current PIN or the last 4 digits of your SSN
   - Changes take effect immediately

2. **Online Account**: 
   - Log in at [account.ourcompany.com](http://account.ourcompany.com)
   - Go to Profile → Security → Update PIN
   - Changes take effect immediately

3. **Customer Service**:
   - Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX
   - You'll need to verify your identity using alternative methods (last 4 of SSN, billing address, etc.)
   - Changes take effect immediately

## Managing Your Online Password

1. **Password Requirements**:
   - 8-20 characters
   - At least one uppercase letter
   - At least one lowercase letter
   - At least one number
   - At least one special character

2. **Changing Your Password**:

- We recommend updating your PIN and password every 90 days
- We will NEVER call you asking for your complete PIN or password

## Impact on Services

- **Billing**: PIN changes may require re-verification for AutoPay settings
- **Multi-line Accounts**: The primary account holder controls PIN settings for all lines
- **Business Accounts**: PIN changes require administrator approval and may take up to 4 hours to process

For additional security, consider enabling two-factor authentication through your online account settings or mobile app.","subscription,account,account pins and passwords,faq,pins,passwords,coverage,customer",2025-04-15,"ID: KB-1213

   - In their online account (immediate)
   - In the mobile app (within 24 hours)
   - On their next bill

4. Send a confirmation email or SMS (based on customer preference).

### 8. Escalation Path
1. If the system prevents the change due to technical issues:
   - Create a ticket for the Billing Support Team
   - Provide ticket number to customer
   - Set follow-up for 24-48 hours

2. If the customer disputes the prorated amount:
   - Escalate to a billing specialist
   - Use warm transfer protocol

### 9. Follow-Up
1. Set a reminder in the system to verify the billing cycle change was successfully implemented after the next bill generation.
2. For high-value customers (account tenure >5 years or monthly spend >$150), schedule a courtesy follow-up call after the first new bill.

### 10. Special Scenarios
1. For customers enrolled in specific promotional plans with date-specific terms, consult the ""Promo Plan Exceptions"" document before processing.
2. For business accounts with multiple lines, additional approval from the Business Account Management team is required.

KB-1221,FAQ,Billing,Late payment fees,What are late payment fees and when do they apply?,"# What are late payment fees and when do they apply?

Late payment fees are charges added to your account when we don't receive your payment by the due date shown on your bill. These fees help cover the costs associated with processing overdue accounts and encourage timely payments.

## How late payment fees work

If your payment isn't received by the due date (typically 21 days after your bill is issued), a late payment fee will be automatically applied to your next bill. The fee is calculated as follows:

- **Standard late fee**: $5.99 for most consumer accounts
- **Business accounts**: $9.99 for small business plans
- **Enterprise accounts**: 1.5% of the outstanding balance (minimum $15.00)

For example, if you have a standard consumer plan with a bill due on March 15th, and your payment is processed on March 18th, a $5.99 late fee will appear on your April bill.

You can avoid these charges by:

- **Setting up AutoPay**: Enroll through our mobile app or online account portal
- **Paying a few days early**: Allow 2-3 business days for payment processing
- **Using our mobile app**: Make instant payments that are credited immediately

KB-1231,FAQ,Billing,Refund policy,What is the refund policy for my account?,"# What is the refund policy for my account?

When you request a refund on your account, our policy is designed to be fair and transparent. Here's everything you need to know about how refunds work with our service:

## General Refund Guidelines

* **Service Plan Charges**: Monthly service plan fees are generally non-refundable once the billing cycle has begun. However, if you cancel within the first 14 days of a new plan (our satisfaction guarantee period), we'll refund the full amount.

* **Device Purchases**: Devices can be returned within 30 days of purchase with the original receipt. The device must be in like-new condition with all original packaging and accessories. A restocking fee of $35 may apply for opened devices.

* **Add-On Features**: Pro-rated refunds are available for unused portions of add-on services like international calling packages or data boosters when canceled mid-cycle.

## Examples of Refund Calculations

**Example 1:** If you purchase our Premium Unlimited plan for $80/month on June 5th and decide to cancel on June 15th (within the 14-day satisfaction period), you'll receive a full refund of $80.

**Example 2:** If you add a 5GB International Data Pass for $50 on March 10th and cancel it on March 20th, you'll receive approximately $33.33 back (20 days remaining in a 30-day period).

**Example 3:** If you return a smartphone purchased for $899 within the 30-day window but the box has been opened, you'll receive $864 ($899 minus the $35 restocking fee).

## How to Request a Refund

You can request a refund through:

* Your online account dashboard at www.ourcompany.com/myaccount
* Calling customer support at 1-800-555-1234
* Visiting any of our retail locations

Refunds typically process within 3-5 business days but may take up to 1-2 billing cycles to appear on your credit card or bank statement, depending on your financial institution.

## Additional Information

* **Taxes and Regulatory Fees**: These are generally refundable only when the associated service charge is refunded.
* **Early Termination Fees**: These are not refundable as they represent a contractual obligation.

If you have specific questions about a potential refund on your account, please contact our customer support team with your account details ready, and we'll be happy to review your individual situation.","troubleshooting,refund,text,refund policy,faq,policy,billing",2024-12-13,"ID: KB-1231

KB-1232,FAQ,Billing,Service interruption credits,How Do Service Interruption Credits Work on My Bill?,"# How Do Service Interruption Credits Work on My Bill?

## Overview
Service interruption credits are adjustments applied to your bill when you experience a significant outage or disruption to your telecommunications services. These credits compensate you for the time you were unable to use the service you pay for.

## When Credits Apply
Credits typically apply when:
- A network outage affects your area for more than 24 consecutive hours
- A scheduled maintenance extends beyond the planned timeframe
- Your service is mistakenly disconnected due to a system error
- A technical issue on our end prevents proper service delivery

## How Credits Are Calculated
Service interruption credits are calculated based on your monthly service charge and the duration of the outage:

1. We determine your daily rate by dividing your monthly service charge by 30 days
2. We multiply this daily rate by the number of days (or partial days) the service was unavailable

**Example Calculation:**
- If your wireless plan costs $60 per month, your daily rate is $2 per day ($60 ÷ 30)
- If you experienced a 2-day outage, you would receive a $4 credit ($2 × 2)

## Credit Tiers by Service Type
Different services may have different credit policies:

| Service Type | Minimum Outage | Credit Rate | Example |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Mobile Voice/Data | 24 hours | Daily rate | $60 plan = $2/day credit |
| Home Internet | 4 hours | Hourly rate | $80 plan = $0.11/hour credit |
| TV Service | 4 hours | Hourly rate | $120 plan = $0.17/hour credit |
| Landline | 24 hours | Daily rate | $30 plan = $1/day credit |

## How to Request a Credit
You can request a service interruption credit through:
- Our mobile app (tap ""Support"" → ""Billing Issues"" → ""Service Interruption"")
- Your online account dashboard under ""Billing"" → ""Request Credit""
- Contacting customer support at 1-800-XXX-XXXX

**Note:** Credit requests should be submitted within 30 days of the service interruption.

## When Credits Appear on Your Bill
Once approved, credits typically appear on your next bill statement labeled as ""Service Interruption Credit"" or ""Network Outage Credit."" If the billing cycle has already closed, the credit will appear on the following month's statement.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is there a minimum outage duration to qualify for credit?**
A: Yes, most services require at least a 4-hour outage for home services or 24-hour outage for mobile services to qualify for credit.

**Q: Do I receive credit automatically?**
A: For major outages affecting many customers, we may apply credits automatically. For isolated issues, you'll need to request the credit.

**Q: What documentation should I provide?**
A: If possible, note the dates and times when your service was unavailable. For mobile services, screenshots showing ""No Service"" can be helpful but aren't required.

**Q: Are there limits to service interruption credits?**
A: Credits cannot exceed your monthly service charge, and some promotional or prepaid plans may have different credit policies.

KB-1233,Guide,Technical,Data throttling,Understanding Data Throttling: A Technical Guide,"# Understanding Data Throttling: A Technical Guide

## What is Data Throttling?

Data throttling is the intentional slowing down of your internet speed by your mobile carrier after you've reached a certain data threshold on your plan. This practice helps carriers manage network congestion while still providing you with continued service, albeit at reduced speeds.

## How to Identify if You're Being Throttled

### Prerequisites:
- Active mobile data connection
- Your mobile device
- Knowledge of your data plan limits

### Step 1: Check Your Data Usage
**For Android:**
1. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Data usage or Mobile data
2. View your current billing cycle's data usage
3. Compare with your plan's high-speed data allowance

**For iOS:**
1. Go to Settings > Cellular or Mobile Data
2. Scroll down to see ""Current Period"" usage
3. Compare with your plan's high-speed data allowance

**Expected outcome:** You'll see if you've exceeded your high-speed data limit.

### Step 2: Perform a Speed Test
1. Download a speed testing app (Speedtest by Ookla, Fast.com, or your carrier's app)
2. Run a speed test while on mobile data (not Wi-Fi)
3. Note your download and upload speeds

**Expected outcome:** If throttled, speeds typically drop to 128Kbps-600Kbps (much slower than normal 4G/5G speeds).

## Common Solutions for Data Throttling Issues

### Solution 1: Upgrade Your Data Plan

1. Log into your carrier's mobile app or website
2. Navigate to plan management section
3. Review available plans with higher data allowances
4. Follow prompts to upgrade your plan

**For Android users:** Most carrier apps provide in-app notifications when you're nearing your data limit.

**For iOS users:** Check the carrier app widget in your Today View for quick data usage insights.

**Expected outcome:** After upgrading, throttling will be removed once the new plan takes effect (typically immediately or within a few hours).

### Solution 2: Purchase Data Add-Ons

1. Open your carrier's mobile app
2. Navigate to the ""Add Services"" or ""Data Add-ons"" section
3. Select a one-time data package
4. Complete the purchase

**Expected outcome:** Additional high-speed data will be available immediately after purchase confirmation.

### Solution 3: Connect to Wi-Fi Networks

1. Go to device Settings > Wi-Fi
2. Enable Wi-Fi and select an available network
3. Enter password if required
4. Confirm connection is established

**Expected outcome:** Your device will use Wi-Fi instead of mobile data, bypassing throttling restrictions.

## How to Prevent Future Throttling

1. Set data usage alerts:
   - **Android:** Settings > Network & Internet > Data usage > Data warning & limit
   - **iOS:** Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Data Warnings

2. Enable data-saving features:
   - **Android:** Settings > Network & Internet > Data Saver
   - **iOS:** Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Options > Low Data Mode

3. Monitor usage through your carrier app:
   - Enable push notifications for data usage alerts
   - Add the carrier app widget to your home screen

## Success Indicators

You'll know your throttling issue is resolved when:
- Speed tests show significantly higher download/upload speeds
- Video streaming returns to higher quality without buffering
- Web pages and apps load quickly
- Your carrier app shows you're under your high-speed data limit or have added data

## Important Notes

- Throttling is different from network congestion, which affects all users in an area
- Some ""unlimited"" plans include throttling after a specific high-speed data threshold
- Prioritization (different from throttling) may still occur during peak usage times even on premium plans
- Wi-Fi usage is not counted against your mobile data plan

If you continue experiencing slow speeds after confirming you haven't exceeded your data limits, contact your carrier's technical support for further assistance.","technical,coverage,wireless,guide,roaming,throttling,data,data throttling",2025-04-26,"ID: KB-1233

KB-1237,FAQ,Billing,Billing cycle changes,When will my billing cycle change if I update my plan?,"# When will my billing cycle change if I update my plan?

When you make changes to your plan, your billing cycle may adjust depending on the type of change and when it's made. Here's what you need to know about billing cycle changes:

## How Plan Changes Affect Your Billing Cycle

Your billing cycle typically remains the same when you make plan changes (for example, the 15th of each month). However, you'll often see prorated charges or credits on your next bill that reflect the partial month of service before and after your change.

### Example of Prorated Billing:
- Your current billing cycle: 1st-30th of each month
- Your current plan: $60/month unlimited plan
- You upgrade to an $80/month premium plan on the 15th (halfway through your cycle)
- On your next bill, you'll see:
  * A $30 credit (50% refund of your previous $60 plan)
  * A $40 charge (50% of your new $80 plan)
  * Your new recurring monthly charge of $80

## Mid-Cycle Changes vs. Billing Date Changes

If you specifically request to change your billing date (rather than just changing plans), this will create a one-time shorter or longer billing period to transition to your new cycle date.

### What to Expect on Your Bill:
When your billing cycle changes, your next bill will clearly show:
- The final charges for your previous billing cycle
- Any prorated charges or credits
- The start date of your new billing cycle
- Your new monthly recurring charges

## Common Questions About Billing Cycle Changes

**Will changing my plan affect my data reset date?**
Yes, if your billing cycle changes, your data allowance will reset on your new billing date.

**Can I choose any date for my billing cycle?**
You can request a specific date, but availability may depend on your account status and payment history. Contact customer service to discuss your options.

**Will automatic payments be affected?**
Yes, your automatic payment will adjust to your new billing date. You can verify and manage your payment settings in your online account or through our mobile app (available for both iOS and Android).

**How will I know when my new billing cycle starts?**
You'll receive a confirmation via email or text message, and you can always check your current billing cycle in your online account or mobile app under ""Account Details"" or ""Billing Information.""

If you have additional questions about your specific billing situation, please contact customer service or use the live chat feature in our mobile app for personalized assistance.","billing cycle changes,service,faq,voice,data,billing,changes,cycle",2025-04-03,"ID: KB-1237

KB-1240,Procedure,Billing,Billing error resolution,Billing Error Resolution Procedure for Telecom Customer Support,"# Billing Error Resolution Procedure for Telecom Customer Support

## Purpose
This procedure outlines the systematic approach for resolving billing errors reported by customers, ensuring accurate resolution while maintaining compliance with company policies and regulatory requirements.

## Procedure

### 1. Initial Customer Contact and Authentication
1. Greet the customer professionally and express empathy regarding their billing concern
2. Authenticate the customer using at least two verification methods:
   - Account PIN/password
   - Last 4 digits of SSN/Tax ID
   - Recent payment amount and date
   - Authorized user verification (if applicable)
3. Document the interaction in the customer relationship management (CRM) system

### 2. Error Assessment and Documentation
1. Listen carefully to the customer's explanation of the billing issue
2. Ask clarifying questions to understand the specific nature of the error
3. Review the customer's billing history in the billing system
4. Document the reported error with specific details:
   - Disputed amount
   - Billing cycle(s) affected
   - Services in question
   - Customer's expected resolution
5. Classify the error type (e.g., duplicate charge, incorrect rate, unauthorized service)

### 3. Investigation and Verification
1. Compare the customer's current bill with their service agreement and rate plan
2. Review usage data relevant to the disputed charges
3. Check for recent account changes, promotions, or credits already applied
4. Verify if the issue is a one-time occurrence or a recurring problem
5. Document all findings in the CRM with timestamps and specific system references

### 4. Error Confirmation and Resolution Planning
1. Determine if a billing error exists based on the investigation
2. If no error is found:
   - Explain the charges in clear, non-technical language
   - Reference specific terms in the customer's agreement
   - Offer to review plan options if the customer is dissatisfied with current rates
3. If an error is confirmed:
   - Calculate the exact amount of the error
   - Determine the appropriate adjustment according to company guidelines
   - Verify if the error affects other customers (potential systemic issue)

### 5. Resolution Implementation
1. Apply adjustments within your authorization threshold:
   - Tier 1 agents: Up to $100
   - Tier 2 agents: Up to $250
   - Team leads: Up to $500
2. For adjustments exceeding your threshold:
   - Place the account on billing hold if necessary
   - Submit the case to the appropriate approval level
   - Provide estimated resolution timeframe to the customer
3. Process the approved adjustment in the billing system
4. Document the adjustment with:
   - Adjustment amount and reason code
   - Billing cycles affected
   - Authorization reference number
   - Your employee ID

### 6. Customer Communication and Education
1. Explain the resolution clearly to the customer
2. Specify when the adjustment will appear on their bill or account
3. Educate the customer on how to:
   - View the adjustment in their online account or mobile app (iOS/Android)

# Billing Error Resolution Procedure for Telecom Customer Support

## Purpose
This procedure outlines the systematic approach for resolving billing errors reported by customers, ensuring accurate resolution while maintaining compliance with company policies and regulatory requirements.

## Procedure

### 1. Initial Customer Contact and Authentication
1. Greet the customer professionally and express empathy regarding their billing concern
2. Authenticate the customer using at least two verification methods:
   - Account PIN/password
   - Last 4 digits of SSN/Tax ID
   - Recent payment amount and date
   - Authorized user verification (if applicable)
3. Document the interaction in the customer relationship management (CRM) system

### 2. Error Assessment and Documentation
1. Listen carefully to the customer's explanation of the billing issue
2. Ask clarifying questions to understand the specific nature of the error
3. Review the customer's billing history in the billing system
4. Document the reported error with specific details:
   - Disputed amount
   - Billing cycle(s) affected
   - Services in question
   - Customer's expected resolution
5. Classify the error type (e.g., duplicate charge, incorrect rate, unauthorized service)

### 3. Investigation and Verification
1. Compare the customer's current bill with their service agreement and rate plan
2. Review usage data relevant to the disputed charges
3. Check for recent account changes, promotions, or credits already applied
4. Verify if the issue is a one-time occurrence or a recurring problem
5. Document all findings in the CRM with timestamps and specific system references

### 4. Error Confirmation and Resolution Planning

2. If no error is found:
   - Explain the charges in clear, non-technical language
   - Reference specific terms in the customer's agreement
   - Offer to review plan options if the customer is dissatisfied with current rates
3. If an error is confirmed:
   - Calculate the exact amount of the error

KB-1244,FAQ,Services,Roaming partners worldwide,What Roaming Partners Does Our Network Have Worldwide?,"# What Roaming Partners Does Our Network Have Worldwide?

## Overview
Our network maintains partnerships with hundreds of telecommunications providers across the globe to ensure you stay connected while traveling internationally. These roaming agreements allow you to use your mobile device for calls, texts, and data in over 210 countries and territories worldwide.

## How Roaming Partnerships Work
When you travel internationally, your device automatically connects to one of our partner networks in your destination country. Your phone displays the local carrier's name, but all usage charges appear on your regular monthly bill. Our system selects the strongest available partner network, though you can manually select a different partner network through your device settings if needed.

## Plan Compatibility
- **Standard Plans**: Include pay-per-use international roaming at standard rates
- **Premium Plans**: Include discounted roaming rates in select countries
- **Global Travel Plans**: Include daily or weekly flat-rate packages with predetermined data allowances
- **International Plus Plans**: Include a set amount of international roaming data, minutes, and texts each month

## Device Compatibility
All our network-certified smartphones and tablets support international roaming. However, capabilities may vary:

- **5G Devices**: Will connect to 5G networks where available with compatible partners, otherwise defaulting to 4G/LTE
- **4G/LTE Devices**: Connect to 4G/LTE and 3G networks
- **Older Devices**: May only connect to 3G or 2G networks where still available

## Activation Requirements
1. Ensure international roaming is enabled on your account (active by default on most plans)
2. Verify your device is unlocked for international use
3. For optimal service, enable roaming in your device settings before traveling

You can confirm these settings through:
- Our mobile app: Navigate to Account → Plan Details → International Services
- Online account portal: Log in and select ""Travel Settings""
- Customer service: Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX at least 24 hours before departure

## Maximizing Value While Roaming

### Example 1: Business Traveler to Europe
Maria travels frequently between London, Paris, and Berlin. She adds our ""Europe Travel Pass"" to her account for $10/day, giving her unlimited data and calling while abroad. Before each trip, she uses our mobile app to activate the pass only for her travel dates, saving money by not paying for days she's home.

### Example 2: Family Vacation to Mexico
The Johnson family is spending two weeks in Cancun. Rather than adding international options to each family line, they add our ""North America Plan"" to just one phone for $5/day and use that device as a mobile hotspot for the family's other devices when Wi-Fi isn't available.

Title: What Roaming Partners Does Our Network Have Worldwide?

# What Roaming Partners Does Our Network Have Worldwide?

## Overview
Our network maintains partnerships with hundreds of telecommunications providers across the globe to ensure you stay connected while traveling internationally. These roaming agreements allow you to use your mobile device for calls, texts, and data in over 210 countries and territories worldwide.

## How Roaming Partnerships Work
When you travel internationally, your device automatically connects to one of our partner networks in your destination country. Your phone displays the local carrier's name, but all usage charges appear on your regular monthly bill. Our system selects the strongest available partner network, though you can manually select a different partner network through your device settings if needed.

## Plan Compatibility
- **Standard Plans**: Include pay-per-use international roaming at standard rates
- **Premium Plans**: Include discounted roaming rates in select countries
- **Global Travel Plans**: Include daily or weekly flat-rate packages with predetermined data allowances
- **International Plus Plans**: Include a set amount of international roaming data, minutes, and texts each month

## Device Compatibility
All our network-certified smartphones and tablets support international roaming. However, capabilities may vary:

- **5G Devices**: Will connect to 5G networks where available with compatible partners, otherwise defaulting to 4G/LTE
- **4G/LTE Devices**: Connect to 4G/LTE and 3G networks
- **Older Devices**: May only connect to 3G or 2G networks where still available

## Activation Requirements
1. Ensure international roaming is enabled on your account (active by default on most plans)
2. Verify your device is unlocked for international use
3. For optimal service, enable roaming in your device settings before traveling

You can confirm these settings through:
- Our mobile app: Navigate to Account → Plan Details → International Services
- Online account portal: Log in and select ""Travel Settings""
- Customer service: Call 1-800-XXX-XXXX at least 24 hours before departure

## Maximizing Value While Roaming

### Example 1: Business Traveler to Europe
Maria travels frequently between London, Paris, and Berlin. She adds our ""Europe Travel Pass"" to her account for $10/day, giving her unlimited data and calling while abroad. Before each trip, she uses our mobile app to activate the pass only for her travel dates, saving money by not paying for days she's home.

### Example 2: Family Vacation to Mexico
The Johnson family is spending two weeks in Cancun. Rather than adding international options to each family line, they add our ""North America Plan"" to just one phone for $5/day and use that device as a mobile hotspot for the family's other devices when Wi-Fi isn't available.

### Example 3: Global Digital Nomad
Alex works remotely while traveling through multiple countries each month. He subscribes to our ""Global Elite Plan"" which includes 20GB of high-speed data across all partner networks for $50/month, significantly less than purchasing individual country passes.

KB-1246,FAQ,Billing,Prorated billing,What is prorated billing and how does it affect my monthly charges?,"# What is prorated billing and how does it affect my monthly charges?

Prorated billing occurs when changes are made to your account in the middle of your billing cycle, resulting in partial charges or credits. Instead of charging for a full month of service, we calculate charges based on the exact number of days you used a particular service or plan.

## How prorated billing works

When you make changes to your account mid-cycle, such as:
- Upgrading or downgrading your plan
- Adding or removing a line
- Adding or removing features or services
- Activating a new line of service

Your bill will reflect charges for only the days you used each service. For example:

**Plan upgrade scenario:**
If your billing cycle runs from the 1st to the 30th of each month, and you upgrade from a $50 plan to an $80 plan on the 15th:
- You'll be charged $25 for the first half of the month on the $50 plan (50% of the month)
- You'll be charged $40 for the second half of the month on the $80 plan (50% of the month)
- Your total plan charges would be $65 for that month, rather than the full $80

## Reading prorated charges on your bill

On your bill, you'll see separate line items for:
1. A credit for the unused portion of your previous service
2. A charge for the new service from the change date through the end of the billing cycle

You can view these details in your online account portal or through our mobile app (available for both iOS and Android).

## Common questions about prorated billing

**Will taxes and fees also be prorated?**
Yes, most taxes and fees are calculated based on your service charges, so they will adjust proportionally.

**When will I see the prorated charges?**
Prorated charges typically appear on the bill that covers the billing cycle when the change was made.

**Do all changes result in prorated charges?**
Most service changes that affect your monthly rate will be prorated. Some one-time fees (like activation fees) are not prorated.

**What if I make multiple changes in one billing cycle?**
Each change will be calculated separately based on the exact dates of each change.

If you have questions about specific prorated charges on your bill, you can chat with us through the mobile app, log into your online account at myaccount.ourcompany.com, or call customer service at the number listed on your bill.","text,faq,prorated,prorated billing,phone,billing,customer",2024-09-26,"ID: KB-1246

## Understanding unexpected charges on your monthly statement

It can be concerning to see charges you weren't expecting on your bill. Here's a comprehensive explanation of common unexpected charges and how to understand them:

* **Late payment fees** ($5-15): Added if payment wasn't received by the due date
* **Restoral fees** ($15-25): Applied when service is reconnected after suspension

### Prorated charges
When you make changes mid-billing cycle, you'll see prorated charges that reflect partial months of service. For example:

* You'll be credited for half of the $40 plan ($20)
* You'll be charged for half of the $60 plan ($30)
* The net difference on your bill will be an additional $10

### Data overage charges
If you exceed your plan's data allowance, you may see overage charges:
* Typical rate: $10-15 per GB over your limit
* Example: 2.3GB over your limit at $15/GB = $34.50 additional charge

### Third-party charges

### Taxes and regulatory fees

* State telecommunications taxes
* 911 service fees
* Regulatory cost recovery fees

## What should I do about unexpected charges?
