# MAGIC # AI-Driven Data Intelligence for Smarter Cookie Franchises
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Welcome to this demo, where youâ€™ll build a powerful AI agent tailored for a cookie franchise business. This agent is designed to empower franchise owners to analyze customer data, create targeted marketing campaigns, and develop data-driven sales strategies that improve their operations.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By using data intelligence rather than generic insights, franchises can understand top-selling products and create campaigns based on actual sales data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook will guide you through creating and registering simple functions in Unity Catalog, providing governed access to insights. You'll then build a chat-based AI using these functions, enabling franchises to develop smarter, data-driven campaigns.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here's what we'll cover:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Creating and registering SQL functions in Unity Catalog
# MAGIC - Using Langchain to integrate these functions as tools
# MAGIC - Building an AI agent to execute these tools and tackle complex questions

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install -q langchain-community==0.2.16 langchain-openai==0.1.19 mlflow==2.15.1 databricks-agents==0.5.0 langchain==0.2.16
# MAGIC %restart_python

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Step 1: Function/Tool Creation in Unity Catalog
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You'll create two functions:
# MAGIC - A simple query to retrieve an ID based on a city name
# MAGIC - An aggregate query that returns sales data for a given ID

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Create Franchise by City Function
# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- First lets make sure it doesnt already exist
# MAGIC DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS workspace.default.franchise_by_city;
# MAGIC -- Now we create our first function. This takes in a city name and returns a table of any franchises that are in that city.
# MAGIC -- Note that we've added a comment to the input parameter to help guide the agent later on.
# MAGIC CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
# MAGIC workspace.default.franchise_by_city(
# MAGIC   city_name STRING COMMENT 'City to be searched'
# MAGIC )
# MAGIC returns table(franchiseID BIGINT, name STRING, size STRING)
# MAGIC return
# MAGIC (SELECT franchiseID, name, size from samples.bakehouse.sales_franchises where city=city_name 
# MAGIC      order by size desc)
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Test Franchise by City Function
# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Test the function we just created
# MAGIC SELECT * from workspace.default.franchise_by_city('Seattle')

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Create Sales Function
# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Again check that it exists
# MAGIC DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS workspace.default.franchise_sales;
# MAGIC -- This function takes an ID as input, and this time does an aggregate to return the sales for that franchise_id.
# MAGIC CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
# MAGIC workspace.default.franchise_sales (
# MAGIC   franchise_id BIGINT COMMENT 'ID of the franchise to be searched'
# MAGIC )
# MAGIC returns table(total_sales BIGINT, total_quantity BIGINT, product STRING)
# MAGIC return
# MAGIC (SELECT SUM(totalPrice) AS total_sales, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity, product 
# MAGIC FROM samples.bakehouse.sales_transactions 
# MAGIC WHERE franchiseID = franchise_id GROUP BY product)

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Test Sales Function
# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Check the sales function works - we're going to use the franchise_id from the previous query
# MAGIC Select * from workspace.default.franchise_sales(3000038)

# COMMAND ----------

import mlflow
import langchain

# This is going to allow us to understand what happens during every part of the agent's execution
mlflow.langchain.autolog(disable=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Step 2: Create Agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step, we're going to define three cruicial parts of our agent:
# MAGIC - Tools for the Agent to use
# MAGIC - LLM to serve as the agent's "brains"
# MAGIC - System prompt that defines guidelines for the agent's tasks

# COMMAND ----------

            Use the franchise_by_city function to retrieve the franchiseID for a given city name.

            Use the franchise_sales function to retrieve the cookie sales for a given franchiseID. This should be run for each franchiseID. Do not ask the user if they want to see another store, just run it for ALL franchiseIDs.

    Make sure to call the function for each step and provide a coherent final response to the user. Don't mention tools to your users. Don't skip to the next step without ensuring the function was called and a result was retrieved. Only answer what the user is asking for."""

# COMMAND ----------

# Lets ask our Compound AI Agent to generate an Instagram post. This requires it to:
#     1. Look up what stores are in Seattle
#     2. Use sales data to look up the best selling cookie at that store

answer=agent_str.invoke({"messages": "What is the best selling cookie in our Seattle stores?"})
