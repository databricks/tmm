# MAGIC # Hands-On Lab: Building Agent Systems with Databricks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Part 2 - Agent Evaluation
# MAGIC Now that we've created an agent, how do we evaluate its performance?
# MAGIC For the second part, we're going to create a more basic agent so we can focus on evaluation.
# MAGIC This agent will use a RAG approach to help answer questions about products using the product documentation.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### 2.2 Create Evaluation Dataset
# MAGIC - We've provided an example evaluation dataset - though you can also generate this [synthetically](https://www.databricks.com/blog/streamline-ai-agent-evaluation-with-new-synthetic-data-capabilities).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### 2.3 Run MLflow.evaluate() 
# MAGIC - MLflow will take your evaluation dataset and test your agent's responses against it
# MAGIC - LLM Judges will score the outputs and collect everything in a nice UI for review
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### 2.4 Make Needed Improvements and re-run Evaluations
# MAGIC - Take feedback from our evaluation run and change retrieval settings
# MAGIC - Run evals again and see the improvement!

# MAGIC # Driver notebook
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This was an auto-generated notebook created by an AI Playground export. We generated three notebooks in the same folder:
# MAGIC - [agent]($./agent): contains the code to build the agent.
# MAGIC - [config.yml]($./config.yml): contains the configurations.
# MAGIC - [**driver**]($./driver): logs, evaluate, registers, and deploys the agent.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook uses Mosaic AI Agent Framework ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation.html) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation)) to deploy the agent defined in the [agent]($./agent) notebook. The notebook does the following:
# MAGIC 1. Logs the agent to MLflow
# MAGIC 2. Evaluate the agent with Agent Evaluation
# MAGIC 3. Registers the agent to Unity Catalog
# MAGIC 4. Deploys the agent to a Model Serving endpoint
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Prerequisities
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Address all `TODO`s in this notebook.
# MAGIC - Review the contents of [config.yml]($./config.yml) as it defines the tools available to your agent, the LLM endpoint, and the agent prompt.
# MAGIC - Review and run the [agent]($./agent) notebook in this folder to view the agent's code, iterate on the code, and test outputs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Next steps
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After your agent is deployed, you can chat with it in AI playground to perform additional checks, share it with SMEs in your organization for feedback, or embed it in a production application. See docs ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/deploy-agent.html) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/generative-ai/deploy-agent)) for details

# MAGIC ## Evaluate the agent with [Agent Evaluation](https://docs.databricks.com/generative-ai/agent-evaluation/index.html)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can edit the requests or expected responses in your evaluation dataset and run evaluation as you iterate your agent, leveraging mlflow to track the computed quality metrics.
