Home Goods,Cookware,GourmetCraft Non-Stick Frying Pan,"# GourmetCraft Non-Stick Frying Pan Documentation

## Product Overview

The GourmetCraft Non-Stick Frying Pan is designed for culinary enthusiasts who seek performance and durability in the kitchen. This high-quality frying pan features an advanced non-stick coating, ergonomic handle design, and full compatibility with various heat sources including induction, gas, and electric stovetops.

### Features:
- **Premium Non-Stick Coating**: Ensures food slides off effortlessly and promotes healthier cooking with less oil.
- **Ergonomic Handle**: Offers a comfortable grip and stays cool during cooking.
- **Induction Ready**: Safe for use on all types of stovetops, including induction.
- **Oven Safe**: Heat resistant up to 350°F (176°C).

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup:
1. **Unpacking**: Carefully remove the frying pan from its packaging. Inspect for any visible damage.
2. **Cleaning**: Wash with warm soapy water using a soft sponge. Dry thoroughly.
3. **Seasoning**: Lightly coat with vegetable oil and heat on low for a few minutes before the first use to enhance non-stick properties.

### Using Your Frying Pan:
- Set the stovetop element to a moderate heat setting before placing the pan on it.
- For best results, avoid pre-heating the pan dry for extended periods.
- Use wooden, silicone, or heat-resistant plastic utensils to avoid scratching the non-stick surface.

## Maintenance and Care

### Cleaning Instructions:

- Ensure the pan is completely dry to prevent moisture buildup during storage.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues:
- **Food Sticking**: Ensure proper seasoning and avoid cooking on very high heat as it can compromise the coating.
- **Discoloration**: Commonly caused by overheating. Regular cleaning should mitigate surface changes, but be cautious with heat settings.

- **Swing Mechanics:** Practice on a wall or serve practice area to refine your swing, focusing on wrist movement and follow-through.
- **Maintenance Routine:** After every match, wipe down the racket frame and strings with a damp cloth to remove dirt and moisture.

### Care and Maintenance

- **Cleaning:** Use warm soapy water and a soft cloth to clean the grip. Avoid soaking the racket.
- **Storage:** Store in a cool, dry place to prevent warping.
